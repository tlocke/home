Here's my submission to the [defamation bill consultation](http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/joint-select/draft-defamation-bill1/news/call-for-evidence/):  

> I am writing to you as part of the consultation on the Draft Defamation Bill. I welcome the direction of the bill, but feel it doesn't go far enough to allow full freedom of speech. I would like to see the whole idea of defamation taken out of the legal system. My view is that any possible good that can come of censorship is greatly outweighed by its harm. I am afraid that any defamation law will be abused by the rich and powerful to suppress criticism and dissent. Thus, I believe that anybody should be able to state any view, whether or not some think it false or malicious.
