The doorbell sounded yesterday. My housemate answered and shouted up that it was for me. At the door was a man who stated, 'I'm from the local electricity company SSE, and I've come to do a rate check' (or words to that effect).

In the UK the electricity industry is divided into companies which own the wires (the [DNO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_network_operator)), and the retailers of electricity (the supplier). DNOs are a regulated monopoly, but each customer can choose their supplier.

The objection I have is that my caller was being a bit misleading to imply that it was a technical, statutory check that needed to be done, when really he was trying to get me switch supplier to SSE.
