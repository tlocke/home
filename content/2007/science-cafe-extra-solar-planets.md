[Last time]({filename}consistency-of-fat.md) it got to the end without me
getting a chance to ask my question. This time at the Science Cafe, mine was
the *first* question: 'What do you make of the [Fermi Paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox)?'. The speaker's answer was that [there are other civilizations, but they're all too far away](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox#Communication_is_impossible_due_to_problems_of_scale). I think that the various answers to the Fermi Paradox are interesting, but I find none of them convincing. What's your answer to the Fermi Paradox?
