I took the photo below when I went to the Co-op yesterday:

This is a much older building.

I took this today. It's an in-joke. How my colleagues will laugh.

A view just outside Lostwithiel.

I think this is the best photo.

I put the unmapped parts [on Open Streetmap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=50.4143&lon=-4.661&zoom=14&layers=M).
