I always look forward to Willem Buiter's posts, and his latest, [on a common tax rate on all forms of capital income](http://maverecon.blogspot.com/2007/10/capital-gains-tax.html) is absolutely spot on. In fact I've added it to [my manifesto](http://www.tlocke.org.uk/page/11).  
  
I especially like the added justification on the end:  

> \[stop the\] privately profitable but socially unproductive labour from tens of  
> thousands of tax lawyers, tax accountants and other tax efficiency experts and  
> free them for socially productive labour
