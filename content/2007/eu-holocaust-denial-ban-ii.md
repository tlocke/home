In an [earlier post]({filename}eu-holocaust-denial-ban.md) I argued against a law prohibiting the denial of the holocaust.  
  
I've just listened to a [programme on Radio 4](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/news/pip/biz61/) where the leader of the BNP used the threat of extradition to France as a way of evading the interviewer's questions on the holocaust. The French law has the effect of sheltering people whose opinions should be subjected to public scrutiny.
