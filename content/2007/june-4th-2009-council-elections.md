On the 4th of June, I've got the Wiltshire Council elections.  
  
My ward is Trowbridge Central, so I've got a choice between John Knight (Liberal Democrat) and Chris March (Conservative). Let's have a look and see what they say...  

John Knight
-----------

Presumably he will follow [A Liberal Democrat Vision for Wiltshire](http://jonhubbard.mycouncillor.org.uk/files/2009/05/winning-wiltshire-manifesto.pdf). The first page emphasises prudence and fiscal rectitude. Good. In the justice section there's a mention of [restorative justice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorative_justice), which is interesting. Education, fairly standard nothing to frighten the horses. Funding decided by local democracy. Environment: okay, but would rather hear talk of free trade than fair trade. They have a 'leisure' section. I hate this use of the word leisure.  

Chris March
-----------

The conservatives' don't seem to have a manifesto for the Wiltshire council elections. There is a [page on Chris March](http://www.wiltshireconservatives.com/index.php?sectionid=100&pagenumber=128), but it contains no details of what he intends to do.  

Conclusion
----------

Well, the Lib Dems have my vote for the Wiltshire council election on June 4th.
