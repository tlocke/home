This is the last book of the first Thomas Covenant trilogy by Stephen Donaldson. I've written about the first two books previously. This third book continues the intense tale of relentless suffering and struggle. I must admit I've not always been in the mood for this trilogy, and have interspersed it with other, less emotionally draining stuff. (Bob at work agrees).  
  
Donaldson has overturned my prejudices about fantasy books. I wouldn't compare him to Dostoevsky, but Donaldson deals with morality, innocence, guilt and suffering in a sophisticated way.  
  
I've just started on a Malcolm Bradbury. Paddy shook his head when he saw it, saying despairingly, 'Tony, Tony..., that's the sort of book that old people read..'
