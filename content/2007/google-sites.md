I've switched [my site](http://sites.google.com/a/tlocke.org.uk/tlocke/Home) over to Google Sites. I made the switch because I was fed up with the adverts for other wikis on Wetpaint. Here are my likes and dislikes about Google sites (or 'cheers and jeers' as they said on Family Guy). First the cheers:  
  

-   Good that one can edit HTML directly, and the editor keeps the HTML exactly as you wrote it.
-   Clean design; little extraneous content outside one's own content boxes.
-   One can edit the navigation box.
-   One can add other boxes (I've added one for the content licence).

Now the jeers:

-   One can add sites eg. /mysite but one can't have a top level site. The top site is actually the log-in screen. I think one should be able to create a top-level site. In fact, if I was designing the thing, I'd just have one site.
-   It's possible to use one's own domain name, but there are severe limitations. I've set up <http://www.tlocke.org.uk/> to point to my site, but this just redirects to the login page. Not much use if you're setting up a site for general internet use.
-   Google Sites allows one to to put pages in sub-directories. But one thing we've learnt about wikis is that all pages should be on the top level.
-   I always use the HTML editor. So there should be a setting to go straight to HTML view, rather than going through the hassle of entering the editor each time.
-   Does funny redirect thing to links.
-   I've compiled a [general wish-list](http://sites.google.com/a/tlocke.org.uk/tlocke/3) for things I'd like a wiki to do.

Well there it is.
