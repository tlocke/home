On Wednesday I had lunch with Andy at the new River Cottage Canteen in Bath. The service was chaotic, but the food was great, the menu exciting. When I say chaotic service, the staff were keen, friendly and helpful; but they were disorganized and poorly trained. I'd definitely go back there though, I prefer enthusiastic bungling over frosty efficiency!
