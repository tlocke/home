I received a junk mail letter from [Sky](http://www.sky.com/), encouraging me to sign up. That was odd, since I'd signed up to the [Mailing Preference Service](http://www.mpsonline.org.uk/). Not wanting to complain to the MPS straight away I rang Sky up to give them a chance to remove me from the mailing list. Unfortunately they weren't helpful, and said they couldn't remove me from the mailing list over the phone. So now I've followed the [MPS complaints procedure](http://www.mpsonline.org.uk/mpsr/complaints/) and sent the MPS the offending letter.
