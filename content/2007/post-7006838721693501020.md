With this and your recent comments on Feed in Tarrifs I think I know what the problem is with your opinions: You keep thinking about things as if we were starting from an ideal place. But we're not.  
  
Green help for homeowners and public institutions would only be unfair if you were starting from the utopian position that NO-ONE was getting an unfair advantage. That's not the case.
