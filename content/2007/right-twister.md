Doing maths is exciting, maths textbooks are boring, reading about the exploits of mathematicians is interesting. So what I enjoyed most about [In Code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Flannery) was the human story of Sarah Flannery rather than the maths itself.

Flannery now works at [TirNua](http://www.tirnua.com/).
