This isn't [metonymy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metonymy), I'm not talking about the cost of blogging. I lost my wallet and a guy called Matt picked it up, found my blog by searching on my name, and emailed me! We arranged to meet at the place I lost it, and he returned it to me and I gave him a bottle of wine as a thank you.
