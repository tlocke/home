The headline for Chris Huhne's [ministerial statement](http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/news/en_statement/en_statement.aspx) published yesterday on nuclear power was, 'No Nuclear Subsidy'. Really? That would be good if true, but the small print says that the UK, 'currently caps operators’ liability at £140m'. Why does the tax-payer have to pick up the bill if something serious goes wrong? I'd expect a wind farm or gas fired power station to be fully insured by the owner, not the tax payer. Why should a nuclear power station be any different?
