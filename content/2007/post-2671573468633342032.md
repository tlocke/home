NO NO NO NO NO!!! What I said was......  
  
.....if time is infinitely divisible, then you never reach the end point (1 minute), so the issues never arises. ......  
  
I wish I could phrase that answer in a more techy way (like Katherine did), but, well I can't!  
  
As to if time is infinitely divisible or not, Tony I look forward to continuing that discussion with you. I laugh in the face of your digital universe theory!
