Andy left a comment on [EU holocaust denial ban]({filename}eu-holocaust-denial-ban.md), that really posed the question: what, if any, are the limits of free speech? I remembered an [interview with Noam Chomsky]() where he said:  

> In brief, speech should be protected up to participation in imminent criminal action. So if you and I go into a store to rob it, and I say "shoot," that's not protected.

I think I'll go with that.
