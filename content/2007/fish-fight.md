I got a bulk email from Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall advertising his [Fish Fight](http://www.fishfight.net/) campaign.

The campaign is asking people to sign the [following letter](http://www.fishfight.net/letter/):  

> To Commissioner Damanaki, Members of the European Parliament and all member state governments,  
>   
> I have seen images of dead and dying fish discarded in European waters.  
>   
> I understand that the current Common Fisheries Policy leads to discarding on a vast scale; for example, half of all fish caught in the North Sea are being discarded because of the current quota system imposed by the CFP.  
>   
> I want this senseless waste of food to end. I want you to use your influence to stop this unacceptable and shameful practice.  
>   
> I am supporting the Fish Fight campaign to help bring about this vital change in our seas.

I have signed the letter, but it doesn't provide any solutions. I think a first step would be stop the EU fishing subsidies. From 2000 to 2006 the [EU fishing subsidy was 6bn EUR](http://fishsubsidy.org/faqs/).
