I find myself in favour of a national DNA database that holds a DNA record for every UK citizen. Isn't this an infringement of civil liberties? I strongly support civil liberties such as freedom of speech and due legal process, but I feel that privacy issues belong in a seperate category.  
  
I personally don't mind being on CCTV for example, and I wouldn't mind my DNA being held on a database. Of course, it cuts both ways. I suspect that one would be thrown out of a shop if one started filming it, and the police probably don't allow people to film them. I support the principle that if they can film you, you should be able to film them.
