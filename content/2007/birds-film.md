When we watch a DVD at my house, it's not unusual for someone to walk out. This time it was Sarita that left. To be fair, she had seen it before and didn't like it the first time.  
  
I felt that the sub-plot of Melanie Daniels arriving and her relationship with the family was added in to fill the story out to film length. That wasn't a bad thing, I'm just trying to work out the thinking behind the film. I'm not brainy enough to understand what the sub-plot was all about though.  
  
I was expecting the special effects to be a bit clunky, but in fact they were really well done.  
  
A good film. I'm glad I saw it.
