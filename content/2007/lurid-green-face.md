I dreamt that I saw a very ill child, a toddler, lying in bed with a lurid green face. I said that he had to be taken to hospital. His mother said they were going to take him, as soon as the father came back. I said NO, the child had to taken to hospital immediately. In hospital the child was treated by doctors. I don't know what happened after that.
