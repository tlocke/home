I didn't really know what to make of Wikileaks. I was forced to think about it a bit more when I came to buy 2 sledges from Amazon. Don't tell anyone, they're presents. Wikileaks put their latest haul on Amazon servers, and then Amazon booted them off. Some called for a boycott of Amazon, but should I join the boycott or not? I bet Amazon's shaking in its boots.
