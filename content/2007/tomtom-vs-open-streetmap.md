On my way home from breakfast at Green Park Brasserie I saw this TomTom van mapping the area. Presumably like Google streetview.

That reminded me of TomTom's recent [attack on Open Source mapping](http://www.tomtom.com/en_gb/licensing/newsletter/201205/didyouknow/), which was [brilliantly debunked](http://www.systemed.net/blog/index.php?post=23) by [Richard Fairhurst](http://www.systemed.net/).
