In response to [Hugo Hallman's comment](http://blog.tlocke.org.uk/2007/10/new-site-own-id.html#c7864901753529347548) I've changed the instructions to make it a bit easier to set up a domain name. Thanks to Hugo for his feedback.  
  
I've also changed the XRDS document so that Own-Id now supports all versions of OpenId.  
  
Btw, we now have 13 users (domains).
