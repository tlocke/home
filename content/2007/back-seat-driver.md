I dreamt I drove a car out of a driveway, but I was driving it while leaning over from the back seat. I could really only steer, although I attempted to operate the pedals with my hands. On the way out I hit two cars. The person whose cars I'd hit saw me and retaliated by ramming my car.  
  
Afterwards I felt guilt and self-reproach for having done such a stupid thing, although I kept telling myself that nobody had been hurt.  
  
Btw, I don't own a BMW, I don't even own a car!
