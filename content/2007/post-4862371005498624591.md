Yeah, the author didn't include Score Voting. He replied to me:  
  
New Scientist asked me to write a piece on the mathematical  
paradoxes associated with elections. I had 1500 words to  
play with. Many items were passing references  
to alert readers to interesting related topics. I wasn't  
writing a technical treatise.  
  
Any interested reader can  
get the full story from the Internet. Readers  
should also understand that the tone of the piece was not  
a scholarly critique of electoral systems, but a bit of fun  
with some maths in the context of a coming election.  
  
They will also understand, I would hope, that subeditors  
at magazines like to spice up the narrative a little, and  
that the extent to which the various systems are 'unfair'  
is often minor - as the examples show.
