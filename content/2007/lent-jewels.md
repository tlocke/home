Hughes has a big thing about dreams. He thinks dreams go into a supernatural archive and then:  
  

> At the last, having thereby made a unique contribution to something beyond us, each of us was to die into that insubstantial but immortal nowhere.

  
Absolutely barmy.  
  
The [story](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lent-Jewels-David-Hughes/dp/0099435071) is of his search for faith, told partly through the lives of two victorian figures. Archibald Tait, an archbishop, and Walter, author of 'My Secret Life'.  
  
Throughout, Hughes uses religious language to describe modern, mundane things.
