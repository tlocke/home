An excellent film that brought up all sorts of moral questions. Boringly, the solution to the problem of conflict diamonds is good regulation. Since the diamond trade is international, it covers many jurisdictions and this makes regulation more difficult. So the meta solution is supra-national political entities such as the EU, which can regulate accross a wide area. The best solution is a democratically elected world government.
