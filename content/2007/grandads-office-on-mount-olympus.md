My dad's on holiday in Cyprus and in a postcard he mentioned he visited [Mount Olympus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Olympus_(Mountain)), and said that Gilbert, my grandad on my mum's side, had his office there. That must have been when he was in charge of the generators at the British Army base. As Gilbert died before I was born, I like these little bits of information about him.
