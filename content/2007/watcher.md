My friend Zoe moved house recently, and was offering people books that otherwise would be thrown out. One of the books I took was 'The Watcher' by Jane Palmer. I think I'm probably missing the point somewhat, but it read like a children's book. Not that that's a bad thing, but was it Palmer's intention?  
  
It kept my attention engaged, and there were some genuinely humorous moments. At one point the android is reprimanded by its creator:  

>   
> 'You did nothing You are totally useless. You will dismantle yourself and cease functioning. You cannot even be trusted to collect elementary information about the planet.'  
>   
> 'I can walk under water. \[...\] And I've got a good job in the police force.'  
One of the things I didn't like was the idea of people having spirits. It reminded me of the [agent detection theory of God and spirits](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/magazine/04evolution.t.html?pagewanted=1&ei=5088&en=a43cfb7b24423cc6&ex=1330664400&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss) that I first read about in Stephen Pinker's 'How the Mind Works'.
