It says on the news that little information is coming out of Burma. Mobile phones cut off, internet cafes shut down etc. Regimes shut off the flow of information so that they can commit attrocities without anyone knowing. To get the information flowing again, why doesn't the UN fly over Burma dropping hundreds of thousands of [Satellite internet access](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_Internet_access) devices?
