I'm on the [Claverton Energy Group](http://www.claverton-energy.com/) mailing list. Here's a (slightly amended) post from me on the safety of nuclear power:

> It seems to me that the problem is the cap on the liability of nuclear power companies if there's an accident. That is, if an accident occurs and its clean-up cost exceeds the cap ([[£140m]{.il} in UK](http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/news/pn11_007/pn11_007.aspx)) then the government has to pay the rest.
>
> If this cap were to be removed, then the financial incentive to reduce insurance costs would drive safety improvements.
>
> Furthermore, the position of the government is that nuclear power shouldn't be subsidized. But is not the cap on liability a subsidy?

I'm pleased that the government is talking about [raising that cap to €1.2bn](http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/news/pn11_007/pn11_007.aspx). It's not enough, but it's a start.
