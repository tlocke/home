The publisher of [Taft 2012](http://taft2012.com/) sent me a free review copy. It's the first time that's happened to me. They must have seen other book reviews here on my blog.

I've been boasting to my friends about this literary honour, but now the time has come to actually write the review I'm conscious that I'm no [F. R. Leavis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._R._Leavis).  
  
If a book can have a personality, it strikes me that the book has the same personality as its protagonist, genial and balanced. I wouldn't describe it as a feel-good book, but my mind turned to it when I was in need of some light, enjoyable intelligent sanity.  
  
President Taft existed in our history, but Heller describes a parallel universe where Taft returns a century after his disappearance. The story then unfolds without any more preternatural events. At a time when US politics seems highly polarized, Taft has a broad appeal that taps into core American values. The book is written by an American, for Americans, but is very accessible to a British audience.  
  
The publishers have linked the book to a website, which I confess I haven't examined in detail. I like the linear book format (either on paper or screen), and dislike non-linear, interactive experiences. I'm sure that's a shortcoming in me rather than anything else.  
  
Would I have become a Tafty? Perhaps!
