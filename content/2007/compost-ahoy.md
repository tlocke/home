The guy who's growing vegetables in my garden asked for a compost bin. Luckily my dad had a spare one; it looks just like the picture above. Now I can put stuff like [banana skins](http://twitter.com/t_locke/status/2064081259) and orange peel in the bin, and it'll get made into compost instead of using fossil fuels being transported to a landfill.  
  
Wiltshire council will have to pay less for its waste disposal, therefore I expect a reduction in council tax forthwith.
