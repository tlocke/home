I [really]({filename}weighed-and-sifted.md) [enjoy]({filename}atonement.md)
Ian McEwan's writing. He's reflective and introspective through his characters, without indulging in navel gazing. You get the feeling that a huge amount of effort goes into his books.  
  
In [Amsterdam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam_%28novel%29), the two protagonists focus on their own work to the detriment of other parts of their lives. In a fitting denouement, the friendship between the two is irretrievably lost.  
Drinking is part of the background of the story. A visitor arrives, and champagne is fetched from the fridge. In my world, champagne is for weddings and such. I do like the idea of having a bottle of champagne chilled and waiting for a random visitor.  
  
Perhaps the next Ian McEwan should be On Chesil Beach. I don't want to binge on him though...
