I never knew Stephen Donaldson wrote sci-fi. I'd [read the Thomas Covenant trilogy]({filename}power-that-preserves.md) and found it intense and somewhat harrowing to read. A friend of Janos' found it difficult to complete, it was so emotionally demanding. Donaldson tends to write about characters undergoing unrelenting mental stress, and Real Story is no different.

We leave the story with Angus Thermopyle having been made into a superhuman cyborg. I'm curious to find out what happens. Definitely up for reading the whole Gap series.
