Today your agent in the field has been playing golf with Charles and Blimp. Charles has constructed a nine-hole course in the grounds of the house. This is hole 5 I think.

If you get the ball in the hoop, it counts as getting it in the hole. This is the approach to the same hole.

The flag is just to the right of the tree in the centre. A divagation: the pylon in the top right hand corner supplies the house with electricity. A couple of days ago it was struck by lightening in a thunder storm (I was cooking a barbecue outside at the time) and the circuit breaker tripped and left the house without electricity.  
  
Oh, and I won the game of golf.
