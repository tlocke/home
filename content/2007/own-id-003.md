I've made a [new release](http://code.google.com/p/openid-delegator/) of the [Own-Id](http://www.own-id.com/) code. There's no single big change, just an accumulation of small things. At the suggestion of John Murray I've [changed the 'about' page to a FAQ](http://www.own-id.com/faq/). Let me know what you think.  
  
Own-Id fact: there are now 88 OpenIds on Own-Id.
