I've come across some good maths puzzles recently. I thought I'd list them so that I don't forget them.  

-   [St Petersburg Paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg_paradox)
-   [Google interview question: Proportion of boys and girls](http://mathoverflow.net/questions/17960/google-question-in-a-country-in-which-people-only-want-boys)
-   [Google interview question: One shot or two out of three shots?](http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/google-answers)
