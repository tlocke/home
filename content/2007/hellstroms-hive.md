I read Frank Herbert's Dune while living temporarily in Wells. A unique time. So Hellstrom's Hive is my second FH, lent to me by Zoe through Charlotte. It's a book of extremely high quality. Written in the the late nineteen sixties, it doesn't feel dated and has all you hope for, including very sharp writing, excitement, and good ideas.  
  
If I didn't know it was written by Herbert, I wouldn't have guessed it was the same author that wrote Dune. Frank Herbert really has risen in my regard of him.
