Here's a conversation I'm having with my bank, [Smile](http://www.smile.co.uk/). Since it doesn't show them at their best, I thought I'd preface the thread by saying that Smile are an excellent bank in general. Their customer service is usually very good, and even in this instance everyone's polite and doing their best. Recently, many banks (Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds TSB and HBOS) somehow persuaded the government to [bail them out using tax payer's money](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8394393.stm). Smile (owned by the Cooperative Bank) hasn't asked for (or received) any handouts from the taxpayer, so I salute them for that.  
  
Anyway, Smile are a good bank, I just seem to have hit a blind spot with them, which the following thread shows:
