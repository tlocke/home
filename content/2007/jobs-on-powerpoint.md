I forgot to mention this in my last
[post on the Steve Jobs biography]({filename}steve-jobs-biography.md), but I was amused to read Jobs' views on PowerPoint:  

> One of the first things Jobs did during the product review process was ban PowerPoints. "I hate the way people use slide presentations instead of thinking," Jobs later recalled. "People would confront a problem by creating a presentation. I wanted them to engage, to hash things out at the table, rather than show a bunch of slides. People who know what they're talking about don't need PowerPoint.

I feel the same!
