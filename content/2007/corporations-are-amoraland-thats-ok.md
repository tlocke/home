I intended to write how corporations are amoral and only concerned with profit, and this isn't a bad thing. Corporations are best seen as a force of nature like the sea. We rightly compel corporations to follow laws, and it's the laws that convey our morality, and the laws that channel this force of nature for society's benefit.  
  
However, [Terry Macalister's article, 'In it for the money'](http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/terry_macalister/2007/06/in_it_for_the_m%3Cbr%20/%3Eoney.html) says it much better than I can.
