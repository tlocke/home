I've been trying to get a scarf like this for ages. I've subsequently been told me that a black weave means you're a supporter of Hamas. Well I'm certainly not that; I think they should stop their rocket attacks on Israel immediately. Of course, Israel should also end its illegal occupation of Palestine.
