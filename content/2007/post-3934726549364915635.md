Yes, that's true, nationalizing it would put an end to buck passing. The problem is that it would also put an end to competition, and competition drives standards up and prices down. It also puts the government in the nice position of being able to regulate the industry without having to run it.  
  
In general I think it's becoming clear in all fields that government is best at regulating and lawmaking, leaving private enterprise to actually provide the service.
