Well I brought a whole lot of books to Charlestown. I've been haunting the caf√©s and restaurants carrying a copy of Anthony Trollope's Dr. Thorne. I always enjoy reading Trollope. I wonder if I can describe to you why?  
  
The guy's a liberal, he has a liberal attitude. These days people would say he's not judgemental. Don't judge me dude!  
  
Yes, he gently points out the hypocrisies, inconsistencies and failings of his characters, but it's as if he's describing what it means to be human, rather than damning the individual he's talking about.  
  
Next book is a Martin Amis. I'll be sitting reading it on the rocks in the sea, like a bookish mermaid. With a beard.
