Here's the electricity substation near Amboise that powered the train I arrived on. I took it because I know someone who works for EDF (that's you Sarah).

And to continue the theme of photos that are of interest to people I know who work for utility companies, here's a picture of the local water treatment works:

Having just got back from walking to Amboise, [je suis tres fatigue]{style="font-style: italic;"}. Or to translate an English idiom into French for humorous effect, I'm on my [jambes derni√®re]{style="font-style: italic;"}.  
  
Looked at objectively, my trip to Amboise wasn't a success. I meant to buy basic provisions, but ended up going from cafe to cafe, unable to remember much after the first two [chocolat chaud.]{style="font-style: italic;"}I \*did\* get some bread and jam (no butter), so I won't starve. Tomorrow I really must get some proper food.  
  
I'll leave you with a picture of a chateau that I have decided to take by force:
