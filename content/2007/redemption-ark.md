If I had regular readers, they'd know that I think that Alastair Reynolds is a genius. I read his series all out of order. Reading [Redemption Ark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redemption_Ark), I gradually realized that I'd read the succeeding book in the series, Absolution Gap. I'm not very good at navigating around the country by car. As a passenger, I'm aware of gradually recognizing the destination. I got this feeling as I got to the end of Redemption Ark, gradually recognizing the beginning of Absolution Gap. Most people are horrified that I read books out of order. It's not out of choice, I'm just not organized enough. Please don't hate me for it!
