In 2014 the UK government [announced](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/open-document-formats-selected-to-meet-user-needs) that open standards would be used for sharing government documents.  
  
Some time ago, I decided to start the [RoboDoc](https://tlocke.github.io/robodoc/) project for monitoring how well the the government were doing in living up to their commitment to open standard. I recently did a tweet to see if RoboDoc would be useful to anyone.

> Also unsure what can be done to improve. We tried a bit of name & shame + contacting the relevant services but there's just so many documents out there. Unfortunately I think this is seen as a very low priority.
