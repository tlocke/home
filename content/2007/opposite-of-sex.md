'The Opposite of Sex' would bear a second viewing. I think there's something wrong with my brain because I find it hard to follow sentences like, "she's my ex-boyfriend's cousin's sister". There seems to be more than average of that sort of thing going on in the film. It's enjoyable and achieves it's aim of avoiding predictable cliches.  
  
Often people walk out during DVDs at my house. This time, nobody walked out!
