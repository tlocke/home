In B&Q's [GU10 white LED lightbulb](http://www.diy.com/diy/jsp/bq/nav/nav.jsp?action=detail&fh_secondid=9415372&fh_reftheme=promo_83953717%2cseeall%2c%2f%2fcatalog01%2fen_GB%2fcategories%3c%7b10099%7d%2fcategories%3c%7b8960079%7d%2fcategories%3c%7b8960082%7d%2fspecificationsProductType%3dLightbulbs&fh_start_index=24&fh_location=%2f%2fcatalog01%2fen_GB%2fcategories%3c%7b10099%7d%2fcategories%3c%7b8960079%7d%2fcategories%3c%7b8960082%7d%2fspecificationsProductType%3dLightbulbs%2fspecificationsSpecificProductType%3dEnergy+Saving+Bulbs&fh_eds=%c3%9f&fh_refview=lister&ts=1194509615021&isSearch=false) I've finally found a low energy replacement for my halogen spotlights. The LED bulb is 1.2W, compared to the 50W of the halogen. The amount of light from the LED isn't as great as that from the halogen. It's also a much whiter light, and makes the halogen look yellow.
