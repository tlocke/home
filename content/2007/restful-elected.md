I've released a new version of [The Elected](http://www.the-elected.com/). Have a look and let me know what you think. I've reworked it a bit to make it more [Restful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer). The thing about The Elected is that it's a wiki, but it's also structured. Whereas Wikipedia is a wiki of a filesystem, The Elected is a wiki of a relational database. Anyway, tell me if you have any suggestions or anything.
