Walking along [Oldfield Road](http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=18/51.37439/-2.37167) on my way to work, I saw a notice attached to a lamppost. It turned out to be a traffic notice restricting parking in Oldfield Park, order [17-012/LC](http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/services/streets-and-highway-maintenance/highway-improvements-traffic-management/traffic-regulatio-9). The council were inviting comments, so I wrote the following in support of the order:

I've heard people say, 'if buses were cheaper and more frequent then I'd use them, but until then I'll keep using my car'. The problem is that cars impede buses, which makes them more expensive and infrequent, so cars have to be removed first in order for buses to flourish.  
  
The reason that everyone can't travel by car without causing traffic congestion is the large amount of space taken up by cars. Buses however take up far less space. This poster shows the space taken up by cars versus buses versus bicycles:

Of course, the absence of cars is a necessary but not sufficient condition for buses to flourish. There has to be competition amongst the bus operators and electronic tickets that work with any bus operator.
