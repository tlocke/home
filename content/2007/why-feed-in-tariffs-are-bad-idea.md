I'm a member of Greenpeace. Have been since my teens. They've just sent me an email on energy policy in which they say call for a [Feed-in Tariff (FIT)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feed-in_Tariff). Bad idea, and here's why.  
  
The problem we've got is the emission of greenhouse gases. Therefore we should make it more expensive to emit greenhouse gases, preferably using a [carbon tax](http://www.tlocke.org.uk/page/1). The two main problems with the FIT are:  

-   It only affects electricity consumption, which is not the sole cause of CO2 emissions.
-   It subsidises a particular solution (renewable electricity).

I believe that it's the job of government to increase CO2 emissions costs, and it's the job of the market to find ways of avoiding those costs (a complex mix of reduction and renewables).
