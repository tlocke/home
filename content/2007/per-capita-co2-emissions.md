Willem Buiter [writes that per capita CO2 emissions aren't important](http://blogs.ft.com/maverecon/2007/12/---page-margin.html). He's right that what we need is a global tax on every tonne of CO2Eq (carbon dioxide equivalent) emitted. But the revenue from that tax should be re-distributed among countries according to population size, according to the [TaxBack](http://www.tlocke.org.uk/page/1) idea.
