I've emailed the [Office of Rail Regulation](http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/)  

> Hordes of people were unable to board the 10:09 from Bradford On Avon to Bath Spa. The train was crowded because of the entirely predictable Bath Half Marathon. A four carriage train should have been put on, rather than the two that turned up.

> Please would you fine the operator.

I'll let you know what they say.
