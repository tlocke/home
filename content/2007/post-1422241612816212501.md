I think my boiler's getting furred up because I can hear fragments of limescale move around when I turn the central heating on. Also, I live in a hard water area and everything gets covered in limescale.  
  
It's a problem because it significantly impairs the efficiency of the boiler.  
  
I'll do another post in a little while and let you know how it goes!
