I disagree with the government's [decision to remove child benefit from higher rate tax payers](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11464300). They should have taxed child benefit instead. As Stephanie Flanders [writes](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/stephanieflanders/2010/10/no_such_thing_as_an_easy.html):  
> Mr Osborne could have \[...\] raised a similar amount, Â£1.1bn - by simply taxing child benefit.

This would have meant that:  

-   The benefit [would still be universal](http://www.polifesto.com/policies/24/), and money wouldn't be wasted on means testing.
-   The higher your income before tax, the higher your income after tax. In other words, you're never penalised for earning more. There must be a special phrase for this, like there is for regressive / progressive tax or flat tax. Can someone tell me what it is please?
