I remember [You Spin Me Round (Like A Record)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Spin_Me_Round_%28Like_a_Record%29) from 1985 (I became pop-aware on 9th March 1981), and now I'm listening to the [version by Flo Rida Featuring Kesha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_Round).  
  
For me, covers fall into two categories; those that simply parrot the original, and those that take the original and make something genuinely new. I am of the opinion that Flo Rida's version is in the latter category.
