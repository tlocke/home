Inspired by an [article in Wired](http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/01/this-old-house/), I've put all the bugs in my house [on BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/tlocke/house/). To see them, click on the [issues](https://bitbucket.org/tlocke/house/issues?status=new&status=open) link. To report a new bug you have to sign up to BitBucket, then create a new issue.
