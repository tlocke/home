This is a book that my aunt gave me. The author describes her experience of being confined to her bed for years with an autoimmune disease. She is inspired by watching a snail in a terrarium next to her bed. She muses on the similarities between the life of the snail and the life that has been imposed on her. It's a precise and moving description of her experience. Enriching.
