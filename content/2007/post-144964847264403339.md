Sorry to disappoint you, but buildings insurance is not just cover rebuild costs your house if it falls down.  
  
A large proportion of it goes towards third party liability.  
  
You'd have to be seriously well off, or stupid, to underwrite yourself for that!  
  
As a issue, why is the text box so unhelpful?
