I've done a little icon for [Polifesto](http://www.polifesto.com/):  

[![Icon](http://www.polifesto.com/images/icon.png)](http://www.polifesto.com/images/icon.png)  

It's the [favicon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon) that the browser puts in the address bar, tabs etc. What do you think? It's okay, you can be honest.  
  
Apart from bugs and odds and ends, [Polifesto](http://www.polifesto.com/) is done for the moment. Also, the example manifesto [La Licorne](http://www.polifesto.com/policies/1/) is finished for the time being. Let me know if you find any bugs or have any ideas for Polifesto.
