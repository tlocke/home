My plan is to [buy some Kingspan Thermapitch](http://www.buildersuperstore.co.uk/products/kingspan_thermapitch_2400_x_1200_x_100mmtp10_insulation/index.html) and glue it to the wall, and then plaster it with [Carlite Bonding Plaster](http://www.yalden.com/product/101600/Carlite_Bonding_Plaster_10kg).
