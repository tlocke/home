When I moved to Bath I tried for ages to get TalkTalk to transfer their broadband to the new house. They were terrible, and just couldn't do it, so I moved to BT, who were excellent. Bill recently asked how much BT costs. I'm with the 10 GB per month option. I've gone over that a few times, and they charge you an extra £5. Anyway, here's what BT have taken out of my account:  
  

  ------------ ---------
  18/07/2012   £6.50
  18/06/2012   £1.75
  17/05/2012   £1.50
  18/04/2012   £6.00
  29/03/2012   £129.00
  ------------ ---------
