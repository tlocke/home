I was listening to Marcus Brigstocke on the Now Show and he mentioned the [Libel Reform](http://libelreform.org/) campaign. I'd like to see the [libel laws abolished](http://www.polifesto.com/policies/22/), never mind reformed. As far as I can see they're a way for rich people to prevent freedom of speech. The veracity of people's writing isn't something the state should become the arbiter of. We've seen how counter-productive that is with the holocaust denial laws on the continent.

Anyway, even though I'd prefer it to be abolished, reform is a step in the right direction, so I've signed [the petition](http://libelreform.org/sign).
