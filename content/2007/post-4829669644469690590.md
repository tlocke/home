Tony - you say there is a danger of governments being bought&gt; where have you been the last 35 years? Have you not noticed that in the US which is the benchmark democracy and which is pushing its dogmatic fee trade policy on the rest of us, is governed entirely by the whims of big business. Each presidential candidate, indeed any candidate has to raise huge amounts of money, and this money is given in return for explicit policy promises.
