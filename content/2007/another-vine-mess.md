The latest news in the [vine saga]({filename}/2007/grape-vine.md) is that I've planted
all three vines against the wall:

The two on the left (Alastair Reynolds and Iain Banks) are a black grape (vitis cabernet
sauvignon bp), and the one on the right (Peter Watts) is a white grape (vitis chardonnay
g p). I know there's not much to see, but crane forwards and you can make out three
canes with the vines at the bottom. Hopefully we'll see some green shoots in the spring.
