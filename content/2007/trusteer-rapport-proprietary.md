Just sent this to my bank, [Smile](http://www.smile.co.uk/):  

> Hi,  
>   
> When I signed in to Smile today, I was presented with a message encouraging me to download Trusteer's Rapport product. I read the licence agreement at:  
>   
> [http://www.trusteer.com/<wbr>rapport-end-user-license-<wbr>agreement](http://www.trusteer.com/rapport-end-user-license-agreement)  
>   
> and I'm reluctant to install it because the licence doesn't give me the freedoms that I'd like:  
>   
> 0. To run the software for whatever purpose I want.  
> 1. To be able to look at the source code to see what it's doing on my computer.  
> 2. Allow me to make changes / improvements.  
> 3. To share the code with other people.  
>   
> Investigating further, I've found that Rapport isn't available for the operating system that I use (Ubuntu), so I wouldn't be able to install it anyway.  
>   
> Regards,  
>   
> Tony.
