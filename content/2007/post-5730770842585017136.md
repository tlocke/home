Personally, I think that agreeeing to agree on State funding is cop out - ie one doesn't have to worry any more about the elephant in the room.  
The elephant in the room is the stranglehold corporations, mainly US have on all democratic governments.  
Lets talk about that.  
After all, it was the UK government and its capitalist masters who organised the export of food throughout the potato famine, and then the people.
