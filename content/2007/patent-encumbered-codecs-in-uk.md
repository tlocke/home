In Ubuntu I installed the H.264 and MPEG-4AAC decoders in the belief that this is legal since the UK doesn't recognize software patents. [Despite](http://web.archiveorange.com/archive/v/3qQsTuWD0xxBWoGArhFB) [searching](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1080686), [I](https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/kaffeine/+question/31533) couldn't confirm this, so I've decided not to use them. It's difficult to uninstall the codecs so I'm simply going to not install them when I install Ubuntu from scratch next month. If you know the legal position on using patent encumbered codecs in the UK, please let me know.
