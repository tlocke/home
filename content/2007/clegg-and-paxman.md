I've just finished watching the Paxman interview with Nick Clegg. Actually, Clegg did better than I thought he would. I was disappointed that the £10,000 income tax threshold wouldn't apply to everyone; if you're earning over £100,000 then it disappears apparently. I'm not earning anywhere near that, but there shouldn't be exceptions to the rule.

A more serious problem was his policy of forcing banks to lend to businesses when they didn't want to. Banks should make their own decisions about who to lend to. Those that get it wrong should be allowed to fail, they shouldn't be bailed out by the tax payer.
