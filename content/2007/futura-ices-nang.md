I bought some Speedo Essentials goggles and went swimming. They let in water, they were uncomfortable, they were wack. I took them back to the shop and exchanged them for [Speedo Futura Ice PLUS goggles](http://store.speedo.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Product6_10151_10202_80300_-1_45352_33314_Y_80301), which are the same as I used to have.

The Futura Ices don't let water in and are comfortable. In short, they're nang!
