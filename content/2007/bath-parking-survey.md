Bath and North East Somerset council is conducting a [survey on car parking](http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/transportandstreets/Parking/pages/default.aspx). Here's my comment at the end:  

> I would like to see more pedestrianization of Bath. In particular the route for pedestrians from Oldfield Park to the city centre should be improved with more zebra crossings and paths. Going further, I think that private cars should be barred from the city centre to make it more pedestrian / cyclist friendly.
