I heard on the radio that someone's come up with the idea of [making it illegal to deny the holocaust in Europe](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6263103.stm).  
I think that the holocaust did happen. Why do I think that? I'd like to be able to say that I've done a thorough review of the historical evidence. I haven't, because I don't have the time, money or skill. In fact, it's such a huge undertaking that no single person can fully investigate it on her own. The reason I believe it is true is that I'm relying on peer reviewed research where knowledge is built up by open argument and evidence gathering.  
  
If there were a law that forbade the expression of a particular opinion, this process of open discussion couldn't work. Therefore, this proposed law would cause doubt about the facts of the holocaust.  
  
Future posts coming up on these two questions...  
  
1. How should we treat holocaust deniers, racist political parties etc?  
2. What, if any, are the limits of free speech?
