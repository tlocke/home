The-Elected.com is completely different now:  
  
<http://www.the-elected.com/>  
  
let me know what you think. I've given up on the idea of having The Elected hold information like areas, institutions, offices etc. because they are already in Wikipedia. The only advantage was that the information in The Elected was in a structured form, but that wasn't a big enough advantage.  
  
The new The Elected is really a database of constituency boundaries that is combined with Google Maps and Wikipedia to hopefully create something useful. Please send me any links to geospatial data of constituency boundaries and I'll put them on the site.
