It was uncanny the way that every scene was exactly as I had imagined it when reading the book. Very moving, I was embarassed to be tearful several times during the film. The theme of typing, cleverly hinted at the fact that this was Briony's narrative. This device ran the risk of cheapening the film by being rather heavy handed, but just about trod the right side of the line. I used vouchers given to me by my brother, so thanks to him!
