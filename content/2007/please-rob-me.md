People do ask me if I'm worried about telling everyone where I am, and I give a few responses:  
  
1. There are two other people living in my house, which makes it harder to find a time when nobody's in.  
  
2. I don't have anything worth stealing. Everything's worth a lot less these days [due to cheap Chinese manufacturing](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8507528.stm).

3. The only time my house has been broken into, it was by the police.
