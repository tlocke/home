I picked up a random book from the library. Bloodmind by [Liz Williams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liz_Williams). The book appealed to me, and I'm trying to work out why. Whether or not it would appeal to others in the same way, I don't know. I think the atmosphere that Williams creates, a kind of tone of the senses, a feeling, that I find I'm in tune with. I think it was just what I needed at the time. I'll come back to Williams again, I'm sure.  
  
For now though, I'm on to Alistair Reynolds' Redemption Ark. Awesome!
