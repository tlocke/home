I had faced the same problem Checking NVRAM and...hang...  
after many attempts to troubleshoot...it was due to faulty CD ROM . I had removed it and now booting as per normal.  
...Yet to replace new one, still running without CD ROM  
So i guess it could be any of the faulty device which causes this'NVRAM Checking" and hang
