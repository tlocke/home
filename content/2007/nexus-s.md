I had my trusty HTC Magic for over 2 years; it was getting a bit long in the tooth. Battery life wasn't too good, it was slow etc. So on Monday I took delivery of a [Nexus S](http://www.google.co.uk/nexus/).

It's really an incremental upgrade, bigger screen, better battery life, faster. The OS is the same, so the things I used to do on the old phone are done the same way in the new one. The hardware though has additional features such as [NFC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_field_communication), which I've yet to get my head around.  
  
In choosing the phone, I wanted it to be as open as possible, so I wanted to avoid the proprietary UI add-ons such as [Sense](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Sense) which HTC uses. Also I wanted the phone to be designed for people to have [root access](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooting_%28Android_OS%29) to it, without having to jailbreak it. The Nexus S fits the bill.
