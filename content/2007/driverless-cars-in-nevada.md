In August 2008, I wrote in [Home James, and don't spare the CPUs]({filename}home-james-and-dont-spare-cpus.md) that by the time my eldest nephew is of driving age (2023), most cars will be driven by robots. I'm still sticking to my assertion! Ben at work agrees, but Laura doesn't. My friend Andy disagrees, but thinks that robot managed convoys of cars may be on the way. My brother still thinks it won't happen. I'm encouraged by Google's attempt to make [driver-less cars legal](http://www.caradvice.com.au/118506/google-driverless-car-almost-legal-in-nevada/) in the US state of Nevada.
