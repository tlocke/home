I've just tried out Second Life and I was pleased to see they've got a Linux version. I was a bit shy and didn't actually talk to anyone. They get you to do a few exercises to make sure you've learnt the basics, and I've just completed those. Btw, if you want to look me up on SL, my name is Quintilian Luik!
