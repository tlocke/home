The Conservatives want to give a [cash reward for being married](http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/apr/10/conservatives-marriage-tax-break-analysis). I think they're utterly wrong, and that [marriage should be disestablished](http://www.polifesto.com/policies/23/).

The syllogism that the Tories trot out is that married couples are good for society, so if we pay people to get married there will be more married people and therefore a better society. The flaw in this reasoning is that [correlation is not causation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation). Marriage is an *effect* of a good relationship, not a *cause*.

Or to put it another way, if the Tories are right and marriage causes a better relationship, then why not force everyone at gunpoint to get married to a random person as soon as they turn 16!
