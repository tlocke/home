Yesterday I received this email from Yahoo!:  

> Dear User,  
>   
> Unfortunately, the time has come to say goodbye to Yahoo! Groups Labs Applications (beta) and Groups Chat. We thank all the users that were a part of this program. We intend to use this learning to enhance Yahoo! Groups further with new features.  
>   
> On July 04, 2012, we will shut down the Yahoo! Groups Labs Â Applications (beta) and Groups Chat. We request you to backup any data that you might have created using the applications.  
>   
> This closure will not affect your other services on Yahoo! Groups.  
> We look forward to continue having you as our customer.  
>   
> Best,  
> The Yahoo! Groups Team

There's a real problem with Yahoo!'s attitude to user content. Content created by a user should never be deleted, and Yahoo! doesn't understand that. It's fine to shut down a service, but the content should remain in perpetuity, not be erased. It's valuable to the user, and until Yahoo! understand that, they won't be trusted by me.
