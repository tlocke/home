Following the FITs post, there have been a number of criticisms of CO2 TaxBack that I hope to rebut.  
  
The tax would have to be so high that the poor would be shivering in their homes before the rich took any action.  
  
There's no overall strategy. Wind turbines would never have developed to their current level without subsidies.  
  
Uncertainty in the future of the tax. The uncertainty means that investment is less likely.  
  
Lobbying by big business would lead to exemptions which would defeat the whole project.
