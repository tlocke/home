When I was given a Kindle, I was delighted that the cable connecting the Kindle to the plug could be unplugged and used to connect the Kindle to the computer! I thought this a great breakthrough and thought that everything should work like that. I was surprised therefore when my Nexus S had a fixed power cable, and then another cable to connect it to the computer.
