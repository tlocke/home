Tell me about it. Blaspheming is such a deeply-ingrained fear. But I don't think I could look up to a god that would take offense from the hubris of someone or something as infinitely insignificant to him (as is always emphasized) as we are.  
  
I was raised to man-up and/or keep an open mind to criticism. If a maggot like me could do that, why can't the man upstairs?
