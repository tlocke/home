I think it was a good idea to add a boolean type to [Python](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29), but I don't agree entirely with [PEP 285](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0285/). Specifically:  

> 4\) Should we strive to eliminate non-Boolean operations on bools in the future, through suitable warnings, so that for example True+1 would eventually (in Python 3000) be illegal?  

and  

> 8\) Should we strive to require that Boolean operations (like "if", "and", "not") have a bool as an argument in the future, so that for example "if \[\]:" would become illegal and would have to be writen as "if bool(\[\]):" ???  

I say yes to both, but the BDFL said no. I say yes because it makes code more readable, reduces the chance of error, and doesn't seem to have any great disadvantages. In the example, instead of `if []:` I would write `if len([]) > 0:`. This approach would also solve the last of the 'resolved issues', because writing:  
  
<samp>if x == True: ...</samp>  
  
would mean the same as:  
  
<samp>if x: ...</samp>
