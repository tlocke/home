Did you try it on a mobile phone? That's where I found it slow. Slower than you'd expect even on 3G. I suspect it's downloading more tiles than are needed.  
  
What is it for? It's for looking at on your mobile to find out where you are, it'll centre the map on your current location using whatever location info your mobile has eg. GPS, location of masts etc.
