Well regardless of how bad it is, can we agree to state funding of political parties? We can't do much about the US, but we can and should reform the UK / EU.  
  
Also, I'm in favour of the EU dropping its protectionist policies unilaterally. I wouldn't try and force other countries to do the same, although I think they would benefit if they did.
