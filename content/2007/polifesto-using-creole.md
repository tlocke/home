[Polifesto](http://www.polifesto.com/) used to use a subset of HTML5 to mark up policies. I thought that this might be a bit unforgiving for users because there'd be an error if the markup wasn't valid XML. Influenced by a [blog post](http://www.wilfred.me.uk/blog/2012/07/30/why-markdown-is-not-my-favourite-language/), I thought I'd give [Creole](http://wikicreole.org/wiki/Creole1.0) a try. Let me know what you think.
