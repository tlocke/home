In France, I played [Boggle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle) with some [really]{style="font-style: italic;"} brainy people. They used an extra-large 5x5 version of Boggle, and only words of 6 letters or longer counted! Also, they don't allow adding an 's' to make a plural. (As a concession to me they allowed 5-letter words, phew.)  
  
I think they may meet their match with Hannah and Charlotte, with whom I play 4x4 Boggle on Facebook. On average they get about 3x my score.  
  
I want to play Body Boggle, which is a combination of Twister and Boggle. I might make a Body Boggle mat. Does anybody want to play it?
