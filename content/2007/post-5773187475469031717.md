Glad you enjoyed it!  
  
I rate Stross very highly as his what-if's and settings are wonderfully creative, while his writing style is often darkly humorous - a fun approach in a genre that often tends towards overly serious tones.  
  
If you liked Wireless you should definitely check out some of his full-length novels - particularly Glasshouse (the first of his I ever read) and Halting State.  
  
I'm more than happy to lend you some(more) next time I see you - half the joy of reading is in sharing favourites with others.
