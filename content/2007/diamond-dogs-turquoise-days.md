This is a book of two short stories by Alastair Reynolds. I've [read and enjoyed]({filename}revelation-space.md) his work before.

My question is, are the stories linked? Is the bulb of toxin from the spire in the Diamond Dogs? I felt that the text hinted at that. Am I reading too much into it?

If forced to choose between the two, I'd say Diamond Dogs was my favourite. I wanted both stories to go on longer. Maybe that means they were the right length!

I enjoyed DD, TD so much that I sought out another Reynolds, Absolution Gap, which I'm reading now, and it's excellent.
