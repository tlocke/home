I think "abandon hope" would be a more apt title. Anyone who can't see the moral vacuum that any company peddling these type of technologys is blind. any government not legislating against them is derelicting their duties. it wraps up everything bad ablut the modern world into one neat pachage - contempt of society, the omnipotence of big business and hate of the poor and needy.
