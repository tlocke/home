I've added mapping to [The Elected](http://www.the-elected.com/). I've only mapped [one constituency](http://www.the-elected.com/map/?selected-latitude=-31.751525328078894&selected-longitude=115.7958984375&zoom=10&center-latitude=-31.69078180613681&center-longitude=115.7958984375) so far. As it's a wiki, anyone can add mapping data to a constituency. Let me know if you try it and have any problems.
