Tomorrow I'm going on a [protest march in Bath](http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2009/01/418340.html) to free palestine. Must make a placard this evening. I'm marching to demand that:  

-   Israel end its occupation of Palestine.
-   Hamas stop firing rockets into Israel.
-   For these two things to be enforced if necessary by a UN force.
