[My website](http://www.tlocke.org.uk/) is a wiki. I'm the only one that can edit it, so you might ask, 'What's the point of it being a wiki?'. The point is that wikis are the quickest and easiest thing to edit, and they keep a track of changes. I had a go with Google PageCreator, but it was way too cumbersome and didn't keep a change history.  
  
Today most wikis are collaborative, but I predict the rise of the non-collaborative wiki. They will displace many web sites build with the Page Creator model.  
  
I'm writing this now because I've just changed from [Wikispaces](http://www.wikispaces.com/) to [Wet Paint](http://www.wetpaint.com/). Wikispaces is great, but you have to pay if you want to use your own domain name. I'm a cheapskate, so I moved to Wet Paint where it's free to use your own domain name. It's worth mentioning that from my point of view the Wet Paint editor is inferior to the one in Wikispaces because one can't control the HTML very well (page fragments in links is one example).  
  
There's a lot to be said about what should and shouldn't be charged for on a web site. But your attention is starting to wander, so I'll leave it for now.
