...you \[Tony\] are bang on with the profit making scheme, thats exactly what would happen. but also i'm not sure of the point of it all. there are far far more problems with knives than guns, perhaps those should be targeted (excuse the pun, fully intended). in fact thinking outside of the box tackling guns, or knives for that matter, is only addressing the symptoms. i would wager that if all the attention (and money) paid to guns (and knives) was put into things for kids to do ie scouts/youth clubs/ etc, there would be a lot less of these sorts of problems, and probably less binge drinking to boot!  
  
guns (etc) are just an easy target for reactive politicians to look like they are doing something. //end rant
