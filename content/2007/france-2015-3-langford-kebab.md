My friend Andy challenged me to solve the [Langford Kebab](http://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/2038/8-dimensional-vegetable-kebab) puzzle. I'm not clever enough to work it out, so I wrote a [computer program](https://github.com/tlocke/geocache/blob/master/langford/langford.py) to work it out by brute force.
