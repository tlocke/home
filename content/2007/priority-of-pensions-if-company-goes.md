Opinion [seems](http://moneyweek.com/right-side-did-the-supreme-court-just-write-down-your-pension/) [divided](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/10200923/No-priority-for-pensions-when-companies-go-bust.html) on whether it's a good thing that the UK Supreme Court has ruled that pensioners don't get priority if a company goes into liquidation. I like the idea of the [stakeholder pension](https://www.gov.uk/personal-pensions-your-rights/stakeholder-pensions), which sidesteps this problem.
