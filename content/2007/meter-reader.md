I've put up a web site for [recording one's electricity meter readings](http://meteread.appspot.com/). It's very basic at the moment. If you try it, please let me know how you find it. The idea is that you get the site up on your phone, and take it to the meter and enter the reading. Later on there could be graphs added, and perhaps a button for submitting the reading to your supplier. Also, I think it probably needs a way of downloading a spreadsheet of your reading. What do you think?  
  
One thing that is that it requires an [OpenId](http://openid.net/). It's hosted on [Google App Engine](http://code.google.com/appengine/), and they have a white-list of the following OpenId providers:  

-   AOL
-   Google
-   MyOpenId
-   Yahoo
-   MySpace

Also, I don't have a name for it yet, so let me know if you have any ideas.
