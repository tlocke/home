Limescale is starting to fur up the boiler in my house. The cheapest solution is one of those magnetic water conditioner things, but I'm doubtful that they work. There's an interesting [article from Cranfield University](http://www.cranfield.ac.uk/sas/water/magnets/) that suggests that that anti-scale magnetic water treatment can work. I think I'll give the [Water Imp](http://www.waterimp.co.uk/) a go as it has supposedly undergone testing by the University of Bath.
