Hello Hugo, you need to go to an OpenId provider such as:  
  
http://www.myopenid.com/  
  
and get an OpenId identifier. Then go to your id page (eg. id.example.com) and enter it in the box. That's it! Let me know if you have any more problems.  
  
In fact, based on your experience I think I know how to make the instructions a bit clearer.
