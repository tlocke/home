I'm trying out Blogger because it seems more flexible than my [existing blog](http://uk.blog.360.yahoo.com/t.locke) with Yahoo!. In particular, with Yahoo! the advertising revenue goes entirely to Yahoo. With Blogger, I receive some of the revenue. Mercenary I know, but there we are. Also, with Blogger I have the flexibility of editing the template so that I can include the licence of my choice for the posts.
