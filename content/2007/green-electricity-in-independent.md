Thanks to Emily and Bob for pointing out an
[article](http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/lifestyle/article2579329.ece)
in the Independent about green electricity that's relevant to my
[post about Good Energy]({filename}was-i-right-to-change-to-good-energy.md).
The article seems to support the view that the extra greenness that Good Energy gives is the retired ROCs.
