Thanks to Patrice for pointing out that the URL of the Imprimatur DTD `http://imprimatur.sourceforge.net/imprimatur-008.dtd` is returning the wrong content type. IIRC it used to be `text/plain`, but then it must have somehow changed to `text/html`, I've now changed it to `application/xml-dtd` which [I believe is correct](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3023.txt).
