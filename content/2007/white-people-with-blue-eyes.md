I'm the target of a [racist comment by Lula da Silva](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7967546.stm) on the banking crisis:  

> "It is a crisis caused and encouraged by the irrational behaviour of white people with blue eyes,"

Willem Buiter has [an interesting
comment](http://blogs.ft.com/maverecon/2009/03/acceptable-racism/) as ever,
but my reaction is, 'The only thing I've got in common with white people with blue eyes, is that I'm white and I've got blue eyes!'.
