I go swimming two or three times a week. I always do a kilometre, and every odd numbered length is front crawl and every even numbered length alternates between breast stroke and back stroke.  
  
I'd like to lay down the law once and for all on how lanes should be used. No arguments, this is how it'll be. Lanes in the swimming pool are like lanes on the motorway. You swim along in the inside lane, and use the middle lane for overtaking. The outside lane is used for overtaking the overtakers. Got that?  

-   **Don't** overtake people *within* a lane. A single lane can only fit two people across.
-   **Don't** feel that you have to stop at the end to let people past, they can overtake you using the middle lane.
-   **Don't** feel frustrated if someone in front of you is too slow, simply overtake them.
-   **Do** remonstrate with people who use the middle lane for going at a medium speed. The middle lane is only used for overtaking people in the inside lane.  

I feel better now I've got that off my chest.
