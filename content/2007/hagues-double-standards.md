I listened to [William Hague](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Hague) on the Today programme yesterday, being questioned by John Humphries on the alleged extra-judicial killing by Israel of the [Hamas official in Dubai](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/feb/19/britain-denies-knowledge-hamas-leader). Hague said he condemned all extra-judicial killings. Humphries asked if that meant that he condemned the extra-judicial killings by the USA [carried out by drones in Pakistan](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/feb/19/taliban-leaders-brother-killed-pakistan). Hague refused to condemn the drone killings.  
  
Hague is therefore guilty of double standards. Is he fit to become Britain's Foreign Secretary?
