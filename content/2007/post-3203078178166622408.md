OK, on my mobile I get error "cant get geo native" msg.  
  
I'm assuming that's because I'm not willing to sign away my life just to enable the GPS bits on my phone? Android is naff, official!  
  
Just for feedback, if I clear the error msg I then just get a blank screen. Could it default to something, or at least give some useful info? I'm not sure too many users will understand the android message.
