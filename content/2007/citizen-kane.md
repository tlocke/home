The poster says, 'Everybody's talking about it!' and people do still talk of it, so I thought I should see what it was all about. So Kazim and Liz came over and we watched Citizen Kane.  
  
For me, the film is a morality tale. Its essence is revealed when Kane's second wife leaves him, and he pleads with her not to, saying how much it will hurt him. She retorts that he only only thinks of the hurt she may cause him, and doesn't think of the hurt he's causing her, and that's why she's leaving.  
  
It's saying, 'if you're a selfish control-freak who is only concerned with outward signs of success, then you'll end up friendless and alone'.
