Told in the first person by a 30 year old recounting the experiences of her 12 year old self, Light On Snow skilfully manages to evoke deep emotions and maintain a narrative tension, using simple language and and everyday thoughts and activities.  
  
Perhaps all the characters were 'good people'. It seems to reinforce my experience that good and bad are easy labels from a distance, but the closer you get the more complicated things are.  
  
This is the first [Anita Shreve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anita_Shreve) I've read, and as I quickly gulped this one down, I look forward to reading more.
