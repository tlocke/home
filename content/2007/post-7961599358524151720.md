Okay, here's my response!  
  
You can get an idea of the friction added by jockey wheels by pedalling backwards. I think the friction is significant, and caused by the jockey wheels, especially if the bike is poorly maintained.  
  
The gear change would work by changing to the smaller sprocket slightly before moving to the larger sprocket. This would mean that the chain would be slacker than usual for a moment, and then back to the normal tension.  
  
With this system you'd only be able to have about 3 or 4 gears in total.  
  
Well those are my rebuttals!
