When Bert stayed at my house for a bit, he left The Godfather. The Schott's Original Miscellany was given to me my brother as a thank-you for being an usher at his wedding. Diary Of A Nobody is a brilliantly funny book, I think Blimp had a hand in choosing it.  
  
Then there's the Anthony Trollope I read recently.
