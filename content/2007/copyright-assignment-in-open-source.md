The issue of copyright assignment for Open Source projects [has come up again](http://aseigo.blogspot.com/2010/09/copyright-assignments-gone-wild-or-why.html), this time regarding Canonical. I've been influenced by Michael Meeks' [writing on the subject](http://people.gnome.org/~michael/blog/copyright-assignment.html). (If you follow the link to his article, beware there's a theological rickroll!) I'm of the view that the contributor should retain copyright, and not assign it to anyone else. This effectively reduces the asymmetric power that a sole copyright holder has with GPL'd code. A [comment on Shuttleworth's article](http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/517#comment-333616) is also against copyright assignment, which brings us nicely back to Canonical.
