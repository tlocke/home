'Why oh why BBC, must we continually...', thus it seemed all letters to the BBC began when I watched TV in the 80s. Now I too have reached the required level of exasperation to write to the BBC: here's my message.  
  

> Dear BBC,  
>   
> Why oh why BBC, must you continue to use proprietary formats for audio on your website? Please would you switch to an open format such as Ogg / Vorbis without delay.  
>   
> With an open audio format, anyone can write the software to listen to it, giving your listeners the maximum freedom. Proprietary formats are often opaque and encumbered with patent / copyright restrictions and can tie users in to particular companies.  
>   
> So come on BBC, unshackle your brilliant content!  
>   
> Yours expectantly,  
>   
> Tony Locke

  
I'll let you know their reaction...
