It seems that MS has quashed the initial early stand that Linux made on netbooks.  
  
This afternoon I'm collecting my shiny new netbook (n110). It comes with XP. I look forward to trying Ubuntu on it, I think there is even a netbook tailored version. I'm also confident that I'll get frustrated with it, give up and go back to XP.  
  
I'm not an MS fan, far from it. I like the idea of Linux, and think Ubuntu is probably the best stab yet. Tony I even admire your unwavering support for Ubuntu. But at the end of the day, I can't help thinking that Linux as a desktop windows replacement is still a way off.
