In the recent war in Libya I think we've done the right thing so far. It's been legal, and I agree with resolution 1973. David Cameron is now talking about arming the rebels. I don't think this would be legal, as it would contravene [UN resolution 1970](http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2011/sc10187.doc.htm), the arms embargo. If it isn't legal, we shouldn't do it. Furthermore, even if it were legal, it would be a bad idea. Libya should be de-militarized, not re-militarized.
