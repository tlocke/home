We were discussing racism, and my dad recommended [The Chamber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chamber). I'd heard people talk about John Grisham, and I must admit I'd avoided him. However, the Chamber was very well written. Good plot, and Grisham really does capture the mood of the prison in the American south (I say that, but I haven't been a prisoner on death row, in fact I've never been to America). I probably won't go reading madly through his entire oeuvre, but I won't avoid him as before.
