I felt a need for some sci-fi and so I went to the library after work and miraculously it was open. There was a single Alasdair Reynolds that I hadn't read, Galactic North. I snapped it up and enjoyed a collection of novellas and short stories, all set in Revelation Space. Immensely enjoyable. A few days later I borrowed Iain M Banks' Surface Detail which I'm reading at the moment.
