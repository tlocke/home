In our village there's an automated farm shop:

You find the food you want by looking in the glass-fronted cabinets. Each
cabinet has a number, and when you punch in the number and pay, the cabinet
pings open. A bit like those Amazon lockers.

I thought this dog-fouling notice was rather graphic:

I've finished
[Iris Murdoch's Under The Net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_the_Net),
which I found hugely enjoyable. Here's a quote from it:

> Certain things I have learnt here: for instance, that my happiness wears a
> sad face, so sad that for years I took it for my unhappiness and drove it
> away.

Now fiddling around with Rust, making a battleships game.
