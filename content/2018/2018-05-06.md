Title: Non-tracking blog

My website and blog were hosted by Google, which tracks people on an industrial
scale. So I've now moved to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using
a site that's statically generated using
[Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/). GitHub Pages have better privacy
than Google, but the deeper point is that a static site stored in a git
repository can be easily moved to another host.

So, this is the first post on the new blog!
