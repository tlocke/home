Title: Getting rid of Google Analytics

I don't want my projects to track users, so I'm getting rid of
[Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/). I've gone on to my
Google Analytics account and found 7 tracking codes that I've set up.

* The first one is the code for OwnId, which was a website that made it easy
  to use a custom host name as your OpenId. OpenId never really took off,
  email addresses are easier as an ID than host names. The code is in an
  [SVN repository on Google
  Code](https://code.google.com/archive/p/openid-delegator/), and I've removed
  the tracking id from Google Analytics.
* I've got Google Analytics tracking ID set up for my old blog. In the blog
  settings it's not activated though. I've deleted the tracking id from
  Google Analytics now.
* [MtrHub](http://www.mtrhub.com/) is a website I made for keeping track of
  utility meter readings. Looking at the code and the website I don't think it
  currently uses Google Analytics. I've deleted teh tracking id form Google
  Analytics now.
* There's also a tracking id for the http://www.own-id.com/. That's closed now
  so I've deleted the tracking id.
* [Polifesto](http://www.polifesto.com/) is a website for anyone to write a
  political manifesto. It doesn't look like it uses Google Analytics at the
  moment. I've deleted its tracking id.
* My old website which http://www.tlocke.org.uk used to point to, apparently
  had a tracking id. The site on Google Pages in GSUite. I've turned off
  Google Pages for `tlocke.org.uk`. I've deleted its tracking id.
* Finally, my [maths website](http://maths.tlocke.org.uk), doesn't use
  Google Analytics any more, so I've deleted its tracking id.


That was a lot easier than I thought it would be.

And now I've deleted my Google Analytics account!
