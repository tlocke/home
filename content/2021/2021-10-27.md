Title: Let Me Tell You About My Spiritual Journey...

I seem to remember that these two quotes are from Daniel Ingram:

* If there's one thing guaranteed to make the heart sink it's someone saying to you,
'Let me tell you about my spiritual journey...'.

* There are all sorts of good ways of learning the dharma: books, teachers etc. the
  only one I wouldn't recommend is the internet.

So, let me tell you about my spiritual journey, which takes the form of internet links.

In the final days of 2020 I experienced a
[Dark Night Of The Soul](https://ronyabanks.com/the-meditators-dark-night-of-the-soul/): 

> Spiritual seekers, beware! The path to enlightenment can be both rewarding and
> treacherous. Many great spiritual seekers throughout time have described how their
> spiritual practices underwent a period laden with darkness, despair, fear, anxiety,
> depression, and hopelessness. This concept was originally coined the “Dark Night of
> the Soul” by St John of the Cross, a Spanish poet and priest in the 1500’s.
> References to the Dark Night can also be found in Buddhist, Kundalini, Pagan/Occult,
> Christian, Jewish, and Islamic literature.

As [Henri Juntilla puts it](https://www.wakeupcloud.com/dark-night-of-the-soul/):

> All I could do was stumble forward. I didn’t know what was going on. I didn’t know if
> I was going to survive. I didn’t know anything. I had no comfort. All I did, and all
> I could do, was put one foot in front of the other, and wander forward in the dark.
> Be kind to yourself during this time. Just do your best. That is enough.

Ingram says that the dharma can be presented in many different ways, each appealing to
a different 'aesthetic' preference in the reader or listener. I found that Shinzen Young
'spoke my language'. Here's clip of Shinzen answering the question, ['After enlightenment, what's left, what's the point?'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptkH0uK1uXM).

I've quoted him in anticipation of finally coming to Daniel Ingram's book
[Mastering The Core Teachings Of The Buddha](https://www.mctb.org/), which was pivotal
in my understanding of the dharma. There are many points where I now don't necessarily
agree with Ingram, but the book does an excellent job of setting out a clear and
coherent position.

I became very taken with the [Satipatthana Vipassana](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/mahasi/wheel370.html) by Mahasi Sayadaw. Written in the 1950s it describes
something of an enlightenment bootcamp where people would come to practice the the
technique of 'noticing'. He writes at the end:

> Impermanence, suffering and non-self will be realized through direct personal
> experience, and with the full development of these knowledges, Nibbana will be
> realized. It will not take long to achieve the objective, possibly one month, or
> twenty days, or fifteen days, or, on rare occasions, even in seven days for those
> select few with extraordinary parami.

It's not for the faint hearted though:

> "In the hard struggle, one may be reduced to a mere skeleton of skin, bones and
> sinews when one's flesh and blood wither and dry up, but one should not give up one's
> efforts so long as one has not attained whatever is attainable by manly perseverance,
> energy and endeavor." These instructions should be followed with a strong
> determination. It may be possible to keep awake if there is strong enough
> concentration to beat off sleep, but one will fall asleep if sleep gets the upper
> hand.

The person that I currently find myself most closely in agreement with is a
mysterious person on the internet who goes by the name of Shargrol. Here Shargrol talks
about stream entry:

> It is entirely possible. Try to feel that in your bones. If you don't think it's
> possible, then of course it won't happen. But "nothing" is always here, always right
> within the gap of individual sensations. It doesn't take much to settle down,
> minimize effort, let reality and awareness just be as it is, dwell in equanimity, let
> equanimity get loose and dreamy, let the distinction between observer and observed
> get blurry... and then drop into nibbana. Very simple, just give yourself the
> opportunity for it to happen by consistent practice.

Shargrol's thoughts come to us as posts to various websites scattered throughout the
web. Thankfully his writings have been collected in
[A Compilation Of Shargrol's Posts](https://shargrolpostscompilation.blogspot.com/p/blog-page.html)

Finally, I'm currently reading
[A Dark Night Of The Soul](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Dark_Night_of_the_Soul_\(Peers_translation\)) by John Of The Cross.
