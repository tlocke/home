Title: Let Me Tell You About My Spiritual Journey...

I seem to remember that these two quotes are from Daniel Ingram:

* If there's one thing guaranteed to make the heart sink it's someone saying to you,
'Let me tell you about my spiritual journey...'.

* There are all sorts of good ways of learning the dharma: books, teachers etc. the
  only one I wouldn't recommend is the internet.

So, let me tell you about my spiritual journey, which takes the form of internet links.

In the final days of 2020 I experienced a
[Dark Night Of The Soul](https://ronyabanks.com/the-meditators-dark-night-of-the-soul/): 

> Spiritual seekers, beware! The path to enlightenment can be both rewarding and
> treacherous. Many great spiritual seekers throughout time have described how their
> spiritual practices underwent a period laden with darkness, despair, fear, anxiety,
> depression, and hopelessness. This concept was originally coined the “Dark Night of
> the Soul” by St John of the Cross, a Spanish poet and priest in the 1500’s.
> References to the Dark Night can also be found in Buddhist, Kundalini, Pagan/Occult,
> Christian, Jewish, and Islamic literature.

As [Henri Juntilla puts it](https://www.wakeupcloud.com/dark-night-of-the-soul/):

> All I could do was stumble forward. I didn’t know what was going on. I didn’t know if
> I was going to survive. I didn’t know anything. I had no comfort. All I did, and all
> I could do, was put one foot in front of the other, and wander forward in the dark.
> Be kind to yourself during this time. Just do your best. That is enough.

Ingram says that the dharma can be presented in many different ways, each appealing to
a different 'aesthetic' preference in the reader or listener. I found that Shinzen Young
'spoke my language'. Here's clip of Shinzen answering the question, ['After enlightenment, what's left, what's the point?'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptkH0uK1uXM).

I've quoted him in anticipation of finally coming to Daniel Ingram's book
[Mastering The Core Teachings Of The Buddha](https://www.mctb.org/), which was pivotal
in my understanding of the dharma. There are many points where I now don't necessarily
agree with Ingram, but the book does an excellent job of setting out a clear and
coherent position.

I became very taken with the [Satipatthana Vipassana](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/mahasi/wheel370.html) by Mahasi Sayadaw. Written in the 1950s it describes
something of an enlightenment bootcamp where people would come to practice the the
technique of 'noticing'. He writes at the end:

> Impermanence, suffering and non-self will be realized through direct personal
> experience, and with the full development of these knowledges, Nibbana will be
> realized. It will not take long to achieve the objective, possibly one month, or
> twenty days, or fifteen days, or, on rare occasions, even in seven days for those
> select few with extraordinary parami.

It's not for the faint hearted though:

> "In the hard struggle, one may be reduced to a mere skeleton of skin, bones and
> sinews when one's flesh and blood wither and dry up, but one should not give up one's
> efforts so long as one has not attained whatever is attainable by manly perseverance,
> energy and endeavor." These instructions should be followed with a strong
> determination. It may be possible to keep awake if there is strong enough
> concentration to beat off sleep, but one will fall asleep if sleep gets the upper
> hand.

The person that I currently find myself most closely in agreement with is a
mysterious person on the internet who goes by the name of Shargrol. Here Shargrol talks
about the progress of meditation:

> A confused, tangled mind is like a hand that is holding onto something. At first, the
> hand is kind of numb and we might not even realize how tightly we're holding onto it.
> But as we practice and grow older/wiser, we realize that indeed we're holding really
> tightly and it's a lot of work for the hand. We might imagine "oh, I'll just let go",
> but our hand has been holding on so long that it really can't just let go. But we can
> create a little bit of space, a little bit of movement through practice, which is
> encouraging.
>
> Unfortunately, when we start waking up the hand and learning how to move it a little,
> we start recognizing how much discomfort is there. Whatever we're holding onto is
> causing pain. It's sharp sometimes like a knife. Other time it's blunt and hurts like
> a sledgehammer. We might stop there, because we don't want to let free whatever is
> inside of our hand.
>
> But we might also notice that when we open our hand, the tissues of the hand are
> starting to get bloodflow and the muscles are starting to unfreeze and the nerves
> become alive. So whatever is in the hand, it's still scary but opening the hand feels
> kind of good. Well actually, first it hurts a little even though we know what we're
> doing is right. Yeah, it still hurts and if anything, there is a temptation to stop,
> not go forward. But something in us knows that going through life with our hand
> permanently clenching around something limits our life -- and we're drawn to fixing
> the problem, even though we don't know how it's going to happen or how long it takes,
> or what the thing in our hand is.
>
> Each time we move the hand a little, we realize things about ourself that drove the
> clenching. We think grabbing onto something will give us protection, make us safe,
> make us smart, make us loved, make us wise, make us respected --- we see how our mind
> thinks and how our body behaves due to our very subtle intentions. 
>
> So we keep trying to move the hand, wake it up a little, and more muscle and nerve
> pain occurs, but we start to see more and more progress. At a certain point, we're
> almost able to see what is in our hand and we want to rush to open it --- and we go
> too fast too soon and reinjure our hand and it locks up again. And then we realize,
> it isn't our decision, we have to work with the hand not against it. We have to
> practice but also allow ourselves to recover from practice. We can't bite off more
> than we can chew. We can't carry more than we can lift. Otherwise, we just keep
> injuring ourself. So we need to learn about pacing and sensitivity and self-care...
>
> Eventually at some point, our hand softens enough that we can open and close it a
> little, we can actually feel a range of motion and be present with the hand. This is
> like going through the stages of insight -- awareness is maintained throughout many
> flavors of mind and there isn't a desire to escape, but rather to be with what is
> occuring as it occurs.  The things that made us grab tighter don't have the same
> reaction anymore. We can be with body discomfort, bliss, fear, misery, disgust, a
> desire for deliverance, and nothing-much-going-on... and we don't quit sitting. We
> sit right through it all. The hand begins to feel safe and cared for and opens even
> more... And maybe we get a glimpse of what's inside ---- and we develop an insight
> that the big thing that we were holding on so tightly to... maybe isn't there. Maybe
> we've been holding on so tightly to our own hand, crippling our own hand, out of
> fantasy and fear. Wow!
>
> So this would be like 1st Path. But here's the thing: even though that glimpse gives
> you new confidence, guess what's involved in the later paths? More relaxing, healing,
> and opening the hand. And awakening is actually having the hand completely open and
> seeing that there is nothing at all in the hand. So it is all about learning to relax,
> heal, and open the hand. That's it. That's everything in this practice.
>
> In this example, it might be tempting to say that getting that first peak into the
> hand is what makes a big difference ---- but hopefully I've poetically shown that the
> real benefit happens every time you sit. Your mind gets better and better the more you
> can "loosen the hand" and this is where the real work and the real benefit occurs. And
> we would never get a glimpse of the nothing in the hand if we didn't do the easy and
> consistent work of trying to loosen it a tiny bit every day.
>
> So nothing heroic is needed and there isn't a special method beyond daily practice and
> daily recovery. Quality practice and then living your life with the new awareness,
> eating well and sleeping well, and then doing it all again. It's the only way. It's
> not really hard practice, but it's long practice. Long and easy is the way to go. Be
> kind with yourself, don't rush, don't slack off. Trust that your own mind is smarter
> than you and you'll learn over time. It's really amazing, even though we don't know
> right now, the mind figures all this stuff out, step by step. That's why there are
> meditation maps -- there is something innate and predictable about how we slowly
> discover this stuff over time.

Shargrol's thoughts come to us as posts to various websites scattered throughout the
web. Thankfully his writings have been collected in
[A Compilation Of Shargrol's Posts](https://shargrolpostscompilation.blogspot.com/p/blog-page.html).

Finally, I'm currently reading
[A Dark Night Of The Soul](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Dark_Night_of_the_Soul_\(Peers_translation\)) by John Of The Cross.
