Title: Sleep

My symptoms are that I'm waking up in the morning with a dull headache, and then I feel<br>
sleepy and irritable throughout the day. This happens every day. It started a few months ago.<br>
<br>
The same symtoms occured a couple of years ago and I went to see my doctor, and I underwent a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_oximetry" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><font color="#497fb1">pulse oximetry</font></a> study.<br>
The results were normal. After a while the symtoms subsided.<br>
<br>
This time I was hesitant about going to the doctor because the tests from last time were negative. However, I am convinced that<br>
something is wrong. So I bought a pulse oximiter. There's an example graph below:<br>

<br>
<br>
The results showed an ODI (oxygen desaturation index) of 0.6 which well within normal levels (I think). So my<br>
current theory is that I've got <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Airway_Resistance_Syndrome_%28UARS%29" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><font color="#497fb1">Upper Airway Resistance Syndrome (UARS)</font></a>. I think the best way to test this theory is<br>
to use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPAP" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><font color="#497fb1">CPAP</font></a> device and see if the symptoms improve. In the UK a prescription is required for this, so I'll my doctor on Monday.<br>
<br>
On 2nd July 2012 I recorded myself sleeping without using CPAP, and found that my breathing was a bit like Darth Vader's. Slight snoring, but nothing much to speak of.<br>
