The idea of this page is to keep a track of the land that the owners of 1, 2, 3, 5 and
5 Shaftesbury Mews, Bath have joint rights over (common land). Here's a map showing the
driveway in yellow and the bin store and bike store that we have equal use of and rights
over:

Recently a parking space was created to the right (towards Shaftesbury Road) of the bike
store as shown below:

The owners of the Shaftesbury Mews houses give their permission for any other owner to
use the parking space. Also, the owners give permission for any other owner to park in
the yellow area, as long as it's not causing an obstruction.
