title: 2024 Shaftesbury Mews Sheds
status: hidden

The idea of this page is to document the ideas of what to do with the two sheds (bike
shed and recycling shed) which have become dilapidated and unsafe. Then maybe have a
vote to see which one gets carried out?

## Option 1

* **Description:** One shed per house as a single structure.
* **Cost:** £25k (£5k per shed)

Notes from Gennady: If we take the space to the pole it works out to be around 12.5m
from the carpark. i have divided into 5 equal areas, which works out to be 6.5sqm
(taking it from the wall to the curb). construction could be quite simple.

## Option 2

* **Description:** Refurbish the existing sheds.
* **Cost:** £3k + VAT ([quote from Molehill]({static}/images/2024/option2.pdf))


## Option 3

* **Description:** Demolish existing sheds and have a green space.
* **Cost:** Unknown, but cheapest option.
