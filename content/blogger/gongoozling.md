Here are a few photos from my rock 'n' roll weekend. We walked from Bath along the Kennet and Avon canal to The George pub.

Thanks to Rahul for these photos.  

Rahul had bangars and mash at the pub, but unaccountably lost his appetite just before they arrived.

Rahul was too coy to release a photo of himself, but he had no such compunction when it came to ducks and swans.
