I'm a fan of [Murray Head's One Night In Bangkok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9mwELXPGbA&list=PLA679D813DB2C004D). As an aside a cherished memory I have is of travelling in the back seat of the car with my uncle driving, aunt in the passenger seat and brother next to me. We were listening to this song on the radio, in the early eighties. I just can't describe the feelings that accompany that memory.  
  
Anyway, the point of this post is that in the song there's an ongoing conversation between Murray Head and the chorus. I wondered what [Myers-Briggs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs_Type_Indicator) types the two fell into. I'd put Head as a [ENTJ](https://www.personalitypage.com/ENTJ.html), and the chorus as [ESFJ](https://www.personalitypage.com/ESFJ.html). What do you think?
