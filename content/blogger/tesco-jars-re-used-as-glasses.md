I've emailed [Tesco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesco) about [re-using jars as glasses](http://blog.tlocke.org.uk/2008/08/jars-to-glasses.html):  

> Hello,  
>   
> In France, jars of chocolate spread, mustard etc, are often designed so that you can re-use them as drinking-glasses when the contents are used up.  
>   
> This seems like a good idea, so I was wondering why we don't take this approach in the UK? Perhaps jars are more expensive to manufacture if they are designed to be re-used.  
>   
> I plan to publish this enquiry, and your response, on my blog. Let me know if that isn't okay with you.  
>   
> Thanks for your help with this query,  
>   
> Tony.
