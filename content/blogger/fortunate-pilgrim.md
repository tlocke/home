I've very grateful to my friend Bert for lending me the 'two books in one volume', The Godfather (see [previous post]({filename}godfather-is-anarchist.md)) and The Fortunate Pilgrim. In Pilgrim an italian immigrant brings up her family in pre-war USA, struggling through life's vicissitudes. It's triumph is to avoid descending into sentimentality.
