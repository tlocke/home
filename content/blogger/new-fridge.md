The door of the freezer compartment of my fridge has broken, and as it's quite old I've [bought a new one](http://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/household-appliances/refrigeration/fridge-freezers/beko-cxf5083w-fridge-freezer-white-12635520-pdt.html). Have I made a good choice? Btw, I've been getting lots of comment spam recently so I've disabled anonymous comments :-o
