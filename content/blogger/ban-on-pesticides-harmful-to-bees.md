I've just been asked to [send a letter to my MP](https://secure.38degrees.org.uk/page/share/bees-urgent-vote) about the proposal to ban some pesticides that [may be harmful to bees](http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/mar/13/owen-paterson-ban-pesticides-bees). I don't know enough about this to write to my MP, but from what I've read scientists haven't reached a settled view on it, and so more research is needed, and so I support the ban.
