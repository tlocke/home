I'm writing from [somewhere in France](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Valence,+France&ie=UTF8&t=h&ll=44.979007,4.617863&spn=0.066542,0.197754&z=13&iwloc=addr). For obvious reasons my precise location cannot be disclosed. I'll file reports back to you at HQ for as long as I remain undiscovered. After that, the game is up.  
  
Yesterday at the house, the pressure of the water supply lessened. I followed the pipe to its source in a stream. The problem was that the level of the stream had dropped below the level of the pipe, so no water was getting in. Charles and I dug a depression in the stream bed so the end of the pipe would be under water. This is how it looked after we had finished:
