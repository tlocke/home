I loved [this book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freakonomics), although of course I didn't agree with all of it. Take the swimming pools versus guns thing. Levitt says that swimming pools are statistically more dangerous to kids to have at a house, than guns. That may be, but swimming pools are fun and so shouldn't that come into the equation?  
  
That said, the Levitt approach and results will stay with me. Thanks Bob for giving me the book for Christmas!
