Just remembered to vote in the [Police Commissioner elections](https://www.choosemypcc.org.uk/area/avon-somerset). My area is Avon and Somerset and my vote was:  

Kerry Barker (Labour)  
Chris Briton (Green)  
  
I voted Barker because of his policy of helmet mounted cameras, and Briton for his drug decriminalisation stance.
