An [interview with William Poundstone](http://www.motherjones.com/interview/2008/01/verdict-is-in-our%20voting-system-is-a-loser.html) convinced me to update the [manifesto](http://www.tlocke.org.uk/page/0) to say that my preferred voting system is [Range Voting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_voting).  
  
Btw, I remember William Poundstone from reading a book of his in the mid-eighties. Good book.
