Free, libre, OpenSource. The names are confusing. I use [copyleft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft) because it applies to all information; software and content.  
  
With that out of the way, the point of the graph is to show to my colleague Janos, that copyleft software is gaining ground on proprietary software. The numbers are taken from the '[Usage share of web browsers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers)' article on Wikipedia.
