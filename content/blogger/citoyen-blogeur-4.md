In the Lamastre area, everyone is exceptionally friendly and polite. Cycling up to Col de St Genest, everybody I encountered said bonjour. Just before I reached the Col, I heard a disembodied voice hailing me. I looked up and there was a friendly bloke standing on the top ofhis flat roof, holding his young son. He said bonjour, and the son said 'hello', practising his English.
