I've been asked to sign the [Raise The Roof petition](http://www.spareroom.co.uk/raisetheroof) to raise the tax free allowance under the Rent A Room Scheme. I won't be signing it because I think that the Rent A Room scheme should be abolished. [All income should be taxed at the same rate](http://www.polifesto.com/policies/16/), otherwise government is effectively subsidizing some activities at the expense of others, picking winners and distorting the market, impeding the creation of wealth.
