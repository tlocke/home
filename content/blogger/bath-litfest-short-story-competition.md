Bill told me about the [short story competition](http://www.johnsbikes.co.uk/competition) run by John's Bikes as part of the Bath Literary Festival. The story must be 50 words or under. Here's my entry, it's called Retrochronophobia:  

> Cycling past Bath Abbey, Rufus looked up, and suddenly the stone changed from an ancient grey to a brand new yellow. His bike collided with a crowd of medieval peasants gathered where the taxi rank once was. Everything was different. Do you fear abruptly jumping back in time?  

Interesting use of Google Docs for the form submission.
