I started off with [The Vengeance Of Rome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vengeance_of_Rome), the last of the Pyat tetralogy. I guessed the twist at the end, but it was heavily signposted. Many of the characters lead glamorous lifestyles, taking lots of cocaine. It made me want to be like them and snort cocaine. I won't though.

There's a lot of irony in the book. You have to be cleverer than I am to pick it all up. I don't yet have a settled view of the protagonist. He was intelligent, but gullible and naive and given to flights of fancy. People say you shouldn't let life destroy your dreams, but that's rubbish, and this book proves it.
