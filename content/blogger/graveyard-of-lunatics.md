I fancied reading one of Malcolm Bradbury's campus novels, but what caught my eye in Bath Central Library was Ray Bradbury's A Graveyard For Lunatics.  
  
Ages ago in the summer, probably 1992, Steve from Uni invited me out to his parents' house in France. There were two books there that I read, Whitley Strieber's Communion and a book of short stories by Ray Bradbury.  
  
A Graveyard For Lunatics is written in a theatrical manner, where all emotion is exagerated, characters are extreme, and events move much faster than in real life. It's set in the 1950s and I think Bradbury is old enough to remember that era. The frenetic, knockabout dialogue doesn't to me have the ring of the 1950s, but what do I know? I'd have said Catcher in the Rye sounded too modern but it was actually written round about then wasn't it?  
  
I have one query about the plot. Why didn't they go and see the 'blind' woman who was with the beast at the restaurant straight away?  
  
Which reminds me of a plot flaw in 28 Weeks Later. Have you seen that film? It's great! The problem is, when the father comes to see his wife when she is strapped down in the hospital, there is \*nobody\* guarding her, and no nurses in attendance!
