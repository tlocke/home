I joined Greenpeace as a teenager in the eighties, but now I'm thinking of leaving them. It's not that I'm outraged at something they've done or not done; I'm not dissatisfied with them at all. In fact I don't know why I'm leaving them at all.

One of the best things about them was that they provided information. Now with the internet I can do all that myself. Also, I don't think they like the same [political ideas as me](http://www.polifesto.com/policies/1/). Another thing is that I'm concerned that Greenpeace is more like a proprietary software company but I'd like it to be more like an [OpenSource project](http://catb.org/esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html#catbmain).
