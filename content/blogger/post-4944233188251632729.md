Don't do that, it's against the law! One should never infringe copyright.  
  
What I'm saying is that film makers will inevitably end up licensing their work to allow people to freely copy it. How will they make money? I don't know, but they can't carry on as they are. Perhaps films won't make money any more. Perhaps they'll be funded by product placement, merchandising, adverts etc. Youtube seems like the way forward.
