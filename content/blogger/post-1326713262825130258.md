Dear Tony,  
I would like to see a clear explanation about security. Now I can only assume that the id works by me "claiming" the id before anyone else does so.  
There also doesn't seem to be a procedure to reclaim an id if I get a problem with my provider. This would leave me with no choice but to repoint my CNAME to another delegator service.  
Finally a privacy statement would also be good, since I suppose the administrators of own-id could in theory hijack my id.
