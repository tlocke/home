Kazim was over last weekend, so on Saturday we went to Bath and had lunch at Komedia, then went to the Victoria Park approach golf course. After that we had ice-cream at Pattisserie Valerie, and then Opa for some drinks and food afterwards.

The next day was Wimbledon, so we had an impromptu BBQ at my house. We had Pimms and strawberries and cream and everything!
