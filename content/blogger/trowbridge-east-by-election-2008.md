On Thursday there's a [Wiltshire County Council](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiltshire#Politics_and_administration) by-election for my ward, Trowbridge East. I've done a little table to help me decide who to vote for. Don't rely on this table for your own information, look at the primary sources.

I think that this is a commercial decision for the Post Office themselves.

The private sector should <a href="http://www.tlocke.org.uk/page/8">*compete to provide health care</a>, funded by central government, with patient choice at its heart. In the meantime, I don't know whether it's right to close Trowbridge hospital or not.*

I favour doorstep collection, together with a [disposal tax on products](http://blog.tlocke.org.uk/2007/11/disposal-tax.html). The current administration [isn't managing to collect cardboard](http://blog.tlocke.org.uk/2008/02/cardboard-recycling.html) even at the current collection points.

Actually I still don't know for whom I should vote. Okay, let's rule out Fuller because my direct experience of the conservatives' running of the cardboard recycling has been lamentable. Alright, I'll support the Green. I'm against his policy of subsidising public transport though.
