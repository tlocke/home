Like [Wireless]({filename}charles-stross.md), Toast is another collection of Charles Stross short stories lent to me by Janos. For me, Toast maintains a higher average standard than Wireless, although Wireless does have some cracking stories.  
  
I hugely enjoyed Toast, and of all the sci-fi I read, these stories come the closest to my own notions about our future. Stross has been influenced by the sort of things Ray Kurzweil talks about; the singularity, [computronium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computronium), uploading living things neuron by neuron.  
  
Btw, I asked Janos the
[robot cars question]({filename}driverless-cars-in-nevada.md), and he gave a considered 'no'.
