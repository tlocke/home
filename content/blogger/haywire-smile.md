I was at Bath Farmers' Market and needed some cash to buy a tarte au citron. The Sainsbury's cash machine said, 'the card issuer has not authorized payment'. I rang my bank, Smile, and they said, 'the system has gone haywire! In the last hour and a half it started sending out new cards to people and canceling their current ones!' A bit like Skynet.
