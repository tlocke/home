Previously I [told you about the UFO activity]({filename}ufos-in-my-garden.md) that occured in my garden. To update you, the mother ship is still there, but the curious rectangular craft have disappeared, replaced by a mysterious pattern of stick-like objects. You can just about make out the sticks in the photo below:

What does this mean? What are they trying to communicate?
