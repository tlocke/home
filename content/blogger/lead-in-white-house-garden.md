I don't want to have the same [problem as Michelle Obama](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jul/02/michelle-obama-vegetable-garden-lead), so I've written to [Structural Soils Ltd](http://www.soils.co.uk/) to see if they can test my soil for me:

> Hi, I intend to grow vegetables in my garden, but I want to make sure  
> that the soil is safe first. Is this something you can help with?

Incidentally, I'm writing this using the [Google Chrome browser](http://www.google.com/chrome).

[![Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en-GB/images/logo_sm.jpg)](http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en-GB/images/logo_sm.jpg)  

It's really fast and really simple. I think it's become my favourite browser :/ I like that there's a single text box for URLs and search.
