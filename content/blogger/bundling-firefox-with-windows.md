I'm annoyed that the EU could force Microsoft to [bundle Firefox with Windows](http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/245994/eu-could-force-microsoft-to-bundle-firefox-with-windows.html). If people want a good OS they can [buy a computer](http://www.dell.co.uk/ubuntu) [with Ubuntu](http://eeepc.asus.com/uk/). Please allow proprietary software a graceful decline and fall.
