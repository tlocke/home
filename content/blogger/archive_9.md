Here's one of the CDT projects I blogged about earlier:

The jaws of the device:

The jaws opened by pushing this forward with one's thumb:

The holes in the barrel are to make the device lighter:

This was one of the first things I did in CDT and I'm still very proud of it. It's an Oxo cube dispenser. It worked like [Jethro Tull's seed drill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_drill). You rolled the wheel with your hand, and an Oxo cube dropped out. The slit is to see when the dispenser needs refilling.

Another CDT project. This was the one that I entered for the exam. It's a desk light. This is the closed, off position.

This is the switch. It comes on when the shade is put in the 'on' position.

Here it is in the 'on' position. You can see that by putting it in the 'on' position the switch turns the light on. The lamp is a halogen bulb just by the tube.

I made this hideous weapon. Didn't use them much. When swinging them around I was much more of a danger to myself than anyone else.
