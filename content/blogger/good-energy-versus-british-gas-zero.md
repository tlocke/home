Bob at work pointed out an article in the [Ends Report](http://www.endsreport.com/) that suggests [British Gas's Zero Carbon](http://www.britishgas.co.uk/products-and-services/energy/dual/green-energy.html) electricity tariff is greener than my [Good Energy](http://www.good-energy.co.uk/) tariff. I wrote the following to Good Energy:  

> I read in the August 2007 Ends Report that British Gas retires 12% of ROCs above its legal obligation for its Zero Carbon tariff, whereas Good Energy only retires 5% above its obligation. I'm a very happy customer of Good Energy, but I'm tempted by the Zero Carbon tariff. Is there a reason why I shouldn't switch to British Gas?
