Normally I read all the manifestos before voting, but this time I don't feel the need. Here's my summary of the parties:  

#### Labour

Gordon Brown has made it clear that to get Britain's economy on its feet he'd continue wildly taxing and spending. I disagree with Brown, and agree with the Conservatives that we need to pay off our debt. I think this is such an important difference that I find myself unable to vote Labour.

#### Conservative

I think it's fantastic that they're against raising the National Insurance tax, I'm all for stopping taxing the poor. I also support their economic policy of cutting public spending, and reducing the debt as quickly as possible. I'm appalled by the Tory EU euro-phobia. Why can't they all be like Ken Clarke?

#### Liberal Democrats

I really like the Lib Dem policy of raising income tax threshold. I wish they'd go further and [stop taxing the poor](http://www.polifesto.com/policies/16/) entirely. Electoral reform is a key aim of the Lib Dems, as it is for me. I'm [in favour of range voting](http://www.polifesto.com/policies/3/). I'm a euro-federalist, I want a united states of Europe as a step on the way to a [world government](http://www.polifesto.com/policies/11/)!

What a shame that [my exchange with Trevor Carbin]({filename}trevor-carbins-just-one-minute-survey.md) revealed the liberal democrats to have some economically illiterate policies.


#### Summary

Labour: Fiscal incontinence. Conservatives: First past the post europhobes. Lib Dems: Better tax system, electoral reform, europhiles.

So on Thursday I'll be voting Liberal Democrat.
