You can now comment on a policy in Polifesto. Here's a [policy with a couple of comments](http://www.polifesto.com/view_policy?policy_key=ag9zfnBvbGlmZXN0by1ocmRyDwsSBlBvbGljeRjaoKsCDA). This policy, 'Citizen's Income' is also the highest rated policy, with 300 points. One of the next things to do is a notification system where you can received email notifications for new versions and comments for a particular policy. As ever, let me know what you think...
