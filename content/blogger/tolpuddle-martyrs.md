I opined that unions shouldn't try and control wages, instead wages should be agreed individually between the employer and the employee. Equally, employers shouldn't club together in cartels to control wages either. Dave disagreed and said to me, 'have you never heard of the [Tolpuddle Martyrs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolpuddle_Martyrs)?'. I had heard of them, but confessed that I didn't know what they did. I had them confused in my mind with the [Jarrow Marchers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrow_March).

I'm completely against price fixing, either by employers or employees, so if this was being carried out by the *Friendly Society of Agricultural Labourers* then it had to be stopped. To send them off to Australia against their will seems a bit over the top though. Also, were the employers guilty of price fixing too? Were they sent to Australia? I doubt it.
