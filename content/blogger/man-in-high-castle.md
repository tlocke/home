Kazim lent me this book after our jaunt in the Malverns. His copy has a US flag with swastikas as the stars. He hoped it would get me funny looks on my train journey home (it didn't).  
  
There are several books that I've had to stop reading due to psychological disquiet, one of them was a Philip K Dick. High Castle had that quality, though to a lesser degree. It's clever, engaging and mildly disturbing. It was a bit too enigmatic for my taste, I like to have everything laid out clearly. I'm not brainy enough to grasp the full meaning of the book. Interestingly, in this book there's a discussion about what an author is trying to say in a book. All very post-modern I'm sure.
