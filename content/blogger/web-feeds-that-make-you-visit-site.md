I'm a subscriber to the web feed of Willem Buiter's blog on the FT website. They've recently changed it so that in the feed you only see the first bit of the post; to see the whole thing you have to click on a 'more...' link that takes you to the web site. This is presumably so that you have to look at the adverts on the page. I don't like this approach.
