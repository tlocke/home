Here's Matt on a bridge in Oxford:

The reason I took it is that the bridge is exactly the same design as the new bridge that's been put up in Linear Park near to me in Bath. I find the design uninspiring. After seeing Victoria Bridge in Bath and the bridges over the canal in Bath, it's depressing that we can't match or exceed their beauty.
