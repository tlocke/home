Bill warned me that The Dark River wasn't as good as [The Traveller]({filename}traveller.md), but I was pleasantly surprised by this, the second book in the Fourth Realm Trilogy by J12H. It carries on the exciting adventures of Gabriel and the Harlequins and Travellers.

Like many others, J12H classes privacy as a freedom. I don't. Freedoms to me are freedom of speech and freedom of association. Also important to me is democracy. The Tabula of the book are undemocratic criminals. I also regard the Harlequins as criminals. If this were real-life I'd say, 'a plague on both your houses'.

But that would have made a boring book. Secret, mysterious things, and violence and guns are fun to read about. I'm looking forward to book three!
