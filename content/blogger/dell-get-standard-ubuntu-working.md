While I'm in the mood for sounding off, I'm not entirely pleased with Dell's
behaviour. Janos at work bought a Dell Inspiron Mini 10v.

It comes with Ubuntu installed, but it's not the standard Ubuntu distribution, it's been tinkered with by Dell, mostly for the worse Janos found. So he installed the latest version of Ubuntu. This meant that the wireless network card didn't work. And here's my message to Dell:  

-   Always use the standard Ubuntu distribution.
-   If the standard distro doesn't run, work with Ubuntu to fix the problem.

Luckily, Janos is interested in computers and managed to get it working. But as he says, this won't do for the average user.  
  
I don't want to overstate the problem, I run two Dell laptops with Ubuntu, and they work really well. Much better than Windows! I'm really pleased Dell is giving users the choice.
