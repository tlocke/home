Dave asked me what the French call a cul-de-sac. I think it's an *impasse*:

Actually, this is my last blog post from France. I'm feeling sad to be leaving, in fact I haven't got my head around the fact that the holiday is ending.  
  
I've been doing a bit of mapping on OpenStreetmap, and I'll post the results once they're visible. Tomorrow I'll take a few more GPS traces before catching my train at about 15:00. Once last lunch in Amboise I think.  
  
Thank you for reading.
