I'm not a fan of short stories. I want a proper story; short story - short changed. With Daphne du Maurier's The Birds, I loved the story but it ended too soon. I couldn't believe it had ended. Can some talented writer finish it off please?  
  
The thing I like about Du Maurier's writing is how she can evoke a dark mood in a very subtle way in everyday circumstances. John Wyndham's writing has a similar quality.  
  
I'm seeing the film this evening. I gather that it's only very loosely based on the book. It'll be the first Hitchcock film I've seen!  
  
PS. My question to you is; would modern double-glazing stop the birds?
