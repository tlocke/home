Today is the anti-penultimate day of the holiday in France, and I'm thinking back to our arrival. La Garde is about 30 minutes drive from Angers, so I hailed a taxi outside the station and we were off! The driver didn't recognize the address, but no matter, I directed him from Google maps. We arrived, he dropped us off and drove away and I looked around for the gite. It was 22:00, and with mounting panic I realized we were in the wrong place. I told Claire not to panic, not realizing that it was I that was panicking, and that she was perfectly calm. Jung would have called it projection. There followed a period of confusion. I phoned for another taxi but my French was so bad that I was unsure whether I'd successfully done so. We waited for ages, but of course the taxi turned up and we made it.

The first book I read was [A Hero of Our Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Hero_of_Our_Time), with a Byronic anti-hero (the title is sardonic I think). On the other hand, he wasn't that bad. It's probably that in the time it was written it stood in contrast to the idealised characters that had always been portrayed.

A few days into the holiday and we were walking from La Garde to Coutures by a roundabout route and we used a track that wasn't on Openstreetmap. [It is now](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=17/47.35453/-0.35798). I hadn't used Openstreetmap for ages, and was pleasantly surprised at how the editor had improved.

The reason for my trip to France was to take a photo of the electricity meter at Château de Montsabert for Giles at work.

I'm a fan of the [Ion data serialization format](http://amzn.github.io/ion-docs/), and for various reasons I wanted to write a parser for it. So I started working on it while in France, and I finished it yesterday. It's called [Pionic](https://github.com/tlocke/pionic). Ion is like JSON, but has support for timestamp and decimal data types, and more besides.

I've just finished reading Jung's Modern Man in Search of a Soul, and he talks a lot about dreams, and how they are a way to access the unconscious mind. I don't really have dreams, but after starting to read the book I frequently had dreams. In my latest dream I was the science advisor to President Barack Obama and I was terrified that he'd ask me what the atomic number of nitrogen was, and I wouldn't be able to tell him confidently.
