I've just heard about the absurd idea to abolish parking charges at NHS hospitals. If this were to be done, it would (if I remember correctly) remove Â£78m from NHS treatment, surely a bad thing.  
  
The poorest people don't own a car, so parking charges don't affect them. If the rich are concerned about parking charges, perhaps they should take the bus?
