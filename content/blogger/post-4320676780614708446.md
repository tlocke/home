At no point did I think of walking out, especially considering that I think my legs were frozen in place. Get the babybio out on your ivy mate!  
  
I agree with you on the complex narration dialogue, I'm still not 100% sure of the relationships. However that didn't reduce my enjoyment. One of the best "rom coms" I've seen.  
  
It got 6.5 on IMDB, I predicted 6.4. Not bad!
