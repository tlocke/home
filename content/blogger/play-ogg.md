From my friends' experience, the main barrier to wider adoption of desktop Linux is that it can't play MP3 files out of the box (due to software patents). So I was interested in the FSF's [Play Ogg](http://playogg.org/) website. This does a good job of explaining the issue. Please will the BBC take notice, and use Ogg for publishing its programmes!
