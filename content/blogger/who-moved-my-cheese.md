I love these self-help, motivational, succeed-in-business type books. Who Moved My Cheese? reminds me of the line in the Vicar of Dibley, 'I can't believe I-Can't-Believe-It's-Not-Butter isn't butter!'. Who moved Who-Moved-My-Cheese??  
  
The message of the book is, 'just accept change and get on with it'. Well, that's often the best thing to do, but there's a sinister side to that message. What if the change is for the worse? Shouldn't it then be resisted, even if that isn't the most expedient thing to do? What about climate change? What about the resistance in occupied France in WW2?
