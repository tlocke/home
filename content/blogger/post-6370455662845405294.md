I've never really understood the whole Linux software patents thing.  
  
One (certainly not the only) of the reasons I've not swapped over to Linux is the lack of file type support "out of the box".  
  
I did come across this though.....

.....a Linux, based on Ubuntu (I think) with lots of support built in.  
  
This reminds me of one of the (many) other problems with Linux, from a normal user point of view at least. CONFUSION! I'm sure if there was one "Linux" out there it would have had a much larger market share by now. As it is, one of the main benefits of Linux, is also the one holding it back the most!
