After reading [Jill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_%28novel%29) I looked it up on Wikipedia, and finding the article a bit sparse, I added the following synopsis:  

> The eponymous Jill is Kemp's imaginary sister, whom he invents to confound Warner. Kemp then discovers a real-life Jill called Gillian, the 15 year old cousin of Warner's friend Elizabeth. Kemp becomes infatuated with Gillian, but his advances are thwarted by Elizabeth and rebuffed by Gillian.

I wonder if my changes will stick, or get edited out?
