Yesterday I went out canvassing for [Wera Hobhouse](http://werahobhouse.wordpress.com/) of the Lib Dems, who is standing for Bath MP. I haven't been canvassing since I went round with my Dad many years ago, when he was a town councillor.  
  
I'm just about to go out again this morning, traveling up to Odd Down. Must make sure I get a rosette this time.
