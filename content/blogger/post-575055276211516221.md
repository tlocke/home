The short answer to your first question is yes. However, since cars wear out, the increased CO2 emissions are only temporary. My giving up driving is the green bit, and selling the car gives me a financial reward at the cost of some CO2 emissions. So it's mixed but the good outweighs the bad.  
  
Miraculously the same argument applies to your second question!
