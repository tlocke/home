My bike has conked out. It wouldn't cost much to repair, but it is 15 years old, and I'd like to get a new one with front and rear suspension. In the meantime I'm borrowing my brother's bike, and haven't actually got round to looking for a new one. My dad and brother are continually on at me to get a new bike, and they have got a point.  
  
My current bike is a Giant Escaper. I've found Giants to be great value, so I'll have a look at what they have to offer first. I think I've narrowed it down to the [Reign](http://www.giant-bicycles.com/EN-GB/bikes/mountain/2435/32486/) and Reign X.
