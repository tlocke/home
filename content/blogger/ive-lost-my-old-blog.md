Before I started using Blogger, I used to have a blog with Yahoo! at http://uk.blog.360.yahoo.com/t.locke.  
  
I moved to Blogger so that I could have my own domain name. I liked the old blog though. It had a cool background image of the shell of my friend's iMac in his garden with plants growing out of it. I'm also nostalgic for my first ever posts. Some time ago Yahoo! deleted my blog, presumably because I'd stopped using Yahoo! email. I'm angry with Yahoo! for forsaking me and destroying my history.

This is a cautionary tale of our times. What happens when the cloud lets you down? I'd be devastated if Google did a similar thing.
