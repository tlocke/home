My car sits in the garage unused. It's in good working order and I've got a licence to drive it, it's MOTed and insured and everything. I've got two reasons for selling:  
  
1. My car runs on a fossil fuel and so contributes to global warming.  
2. One could easily have (cause?) an accident.  
  
and I've got two reasons for not selling:  
  
1. Life requires the use of a car from time to time, and I'd inevitably end up getting lifts from other people and not be able to give them lifts in return. I'd feel bad about that. Yes, I could always hire a car, but that would rule out spur of the moment trips, which is one of the joys of driving.  
  
2. Everything involves risk, and I don't want to fall victim to the [runaway train fallacy](http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_200604/ai_n16523062).  
  
I think that since my car is unused it means I've already made up my mind. Now it's just wasting money.
