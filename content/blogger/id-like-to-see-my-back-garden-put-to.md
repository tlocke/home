I'd like to see my back garden put to use. I have in mind an allotment. The problem is that I haven't got the interest or enthusiasm to actually do the hard work of growing vegetables.  
  
So my plan is to rent out my garden as an allotment, through the district council. Apparently there's a shortage of allotments, and the district council already has a scheme set up. I'll let you know what happens.  
  
I'm giving this the CO2 footprint label because:  

-   I wouldn't have to mow the back garden every week, which causes CO2 emissions.
-   Food grown locally should be less CO2 intensive.
