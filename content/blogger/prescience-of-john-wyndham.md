Whenever I read John Wyndham, I'm struck by how prescient his thoughts are. Here he is talking about what we'd now call [disruptive technologies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_technology):  

> The discoverer and inventor are the bane of business. A little sand in the works is comparatively a mere nothing - you just replace the damaged parts, and go on. But the appearance of a new process, a new substance, when you are all organized and tickling nicely, is the very devil. Sometimes it is worse than that - it just cannot be allowed to occur. Too much is at stake. If you can't use legal methods, you must try others.

This is from The Day Of The Triffids, which I'm reading at the moment. There are lots of other comments and asides throughout his books that are astonishingly far-sighted.
