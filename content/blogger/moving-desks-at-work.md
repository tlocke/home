I'm moving desks tomorrow at work, and thought I'd clear some stuff out. Louisa at work showed us how to make watercress heads, where the cress is the hair. This is my effort. When I took the photo, the cress had died off from neglect! The pipe cleaner is a beard.

Don't worry, that top-right postcard is a traditional Catholic ceremony in Spain.
