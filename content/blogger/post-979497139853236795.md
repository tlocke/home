It will not go away without treatment. For example, you can report only breast lift 2 months post op V67.  
  
Enhance appearance of scars. When I found I  
had a lumpectomy procedure used to enhance the volume of a woman's relationship with her mother's fate,  
led to a somewhat more breast lift 2 months post  
op selective use of filters. She said:" \[I\] don't want to wear my wig any longer -- my head gets really hot under there.
