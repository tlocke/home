Toby at work quoted the following from the post:  
  
" Similarly, Good Energy has also always held onto 100% of its Levy  
Exemption Certificates (LECs) to ensure that the renewable benefits of  
the electricity supplied are not double counted."  
  
and then asked:  
  
'I thought LECs aren't tradable?'  
  
Yes, I thought so too. I looked it up on Wikipedia but it doesn't have a page on LECs. It seemed it used to be there but not anymore. The closest I could get was [a small paragraph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_electricity_in_the_United_Kingdom#Climate_Change_Levy) that seems to suggest that LECs are tradable.
