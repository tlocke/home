I wage an intermittent campaign to get people to use [Ogg Vorbis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorbis) rather than MP3 because MP3 is encumbered by patents. Here's my latest message:  

> Hi, I went to [http://www.hooverdamdownload.<wbr>com/](http://www.hooverdamdownload.com/) to download the album, but it was only available in the MP3 format. Could you consider offering it in the Ogg Vorbis format please?

I wanted to listen to the track, [Please don't put me on a slow boat to Trowbridge]{style="font-style: italic;"}.
