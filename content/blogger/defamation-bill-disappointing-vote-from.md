I've [written]({filename}abolish-libel-laws.md) [previously]({filename}pass-libel-reform-bil.md) about the Defamation Bill, and I've written again to my MP Don Foster:  

> Reading the [Commons debate on 16th April on the Defamation Bill](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130416/debtext/130416-0003.htm#13041655000001), I was disappointed to see that you voted for rejecting the Lords' second amendment which would have restricted companies from suing individuals.

**Update:** Don's office have replied with:

> Lib Julian Huppert and Simon Hughes managed to get the Government to agree to a revised amendment. You can read about it [here](http://www.libdemvoice.org/julian-huppert-writes-update-on-the-defamation-bill-34138.html#utm_source=libdemvoice.org&utm_medium=redirect&utm_campaign=url).

I am a bit confused as to why the Lib Dems voted in favour of rejecting the Lords' second amendment, but then seem to be including it again. I think I probably don't understand these things properly!
