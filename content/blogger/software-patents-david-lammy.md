The latest on my [mini-campaign]({filename}software-patents-replies.md) against software patents: my MP, Andrew Murrison, wrote on my behalf to [David Lammy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lammy), the Minister of State for Higher Education and Intellectual Property.  
  
In his reply, David mentioned that the President of the European Patent Office has referred the question of software patents to the Enlarged Board of Appeal. David's team are planning a study into the economic impact of software patents, the results of which may be submitted to the Enlarged Board of Appeal.
