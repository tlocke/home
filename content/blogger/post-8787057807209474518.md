Agree that other things need to be done too - scouts, football etc, but need to get rid of guns first.  
  
Tony is wrong to think that the police buying the guns would lead to people making and selling them to the police.  
  
Anyone making a gun, which is hard to do in secret, can't be out robbing old ladies.  
  
People trading guns, by definition are not in secret, and anyone in the chain knows that they can get more cash by grassing the sellers or dealers up than taking it to the police.
