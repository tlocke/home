Own-Id used to create it's own Yadis document for each domain. I realized this was ridiculous, and so now I've changed things so that the Yadis document is the one from the provider. All this should mean fewer glitches. Please let me know of any web site / provider combination that fail with Own-Id, but that work with the provider's own id.
