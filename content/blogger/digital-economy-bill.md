The [Digital Economy Bill](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldbills/001/10001.i-ii.html) says that the government can cut off your internet access. Cutting off internet access to a household can never be justified, even if a person in the household has committed a crime that involved using the internet.  
  
If someone commits a crime involving water, the government quite rightly can't cut off the water supply to their household. Likewise the telephone. The internet falls into this category, the government should never be allowed to cut off a household's internet access.
