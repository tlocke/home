There's nothing more boring than hearing about somebody else's broadband problems. So, a perfect topic for this blog then.  
  
I got a new router from TalkTalk, but browsing the web was still really slow. I did a [broadband speed test](http://www.talktalk.co.uk/products/broadband-guide/broadband-speed-test#speed-test), and the speed was fine. I thought it might be that DNS lookups were slow, so I followed the [advice on the unofficial TalkTalk blog](http://talktalkhell.wordpress.com/2006/12/20/dns-settings-for-talk-talk-users-especially-netgear-users/) and set the DNS servers manually. Now everything works fine!

You can see from the picture that the router doubles as a photo frame. Also, I've got a feeling that it uses a lot less electricity than the old router, simply because the transformer and router don't get as hot.
