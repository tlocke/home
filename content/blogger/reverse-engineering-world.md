I woke up and saw a chair.

You know those [Amazon recommends](http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=13316081) engines on websites? Well a concern is that you never get to see new things, it just give you more of the same.  
  
I wonder if the same thing is happening with our immediate environment (hence the chair). The steps are:  

1.  Physicists [experience their environment](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8461591.stm).
2.  They create theories to explain what they see.
3.  Engineers use these theories to create our environment.
4.  Physicists experience this environment...

In other words, physics is the reverse-engineering of the environment. If we create the environment, we just get our own rules back. Even worse for virtual worlds.  
  
Is this really a problem? If so, what can be done about it?
