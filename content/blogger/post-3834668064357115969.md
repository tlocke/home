It's true that you'll never get totally free markets, but the freer they are the better.  
  
You are right to attack EU protectionism. Let's scrap the Common Agricultural Policy!  
  
You raise the problem of countries exporting food during a famine. This is why governments should redistribute the wealth generated by free markets, so that the poor can afford to buy food.  
  
Lastly, it's true that there's a danger of governments being bribed by the rich. But this is a potential problem under any system. One thing that would help is [state funding of political parties](http://www.tlocke.org.uk/page/13), and banning any other form of fundraising.
