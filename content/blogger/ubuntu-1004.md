I finally upgraded to [Ubuntu 10.04](http://www.ubuntu.com/) yesterday.

This was the first time I'd upgraded an existing installation, usually I wipe the disk and install afresh. The only problem I encountered after the upgrade was that the volume control was missing from the Gnome panel, but that was [easily solved](http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=9200476&postcount=5).

The new version appears to solve a bug I had whereby switching between applications that used sound didn't work. Eg. before I couldn't listen to Radio 4 and then Spotify without rebooting in between, but I can now.

In other Ubuntu news, I saw someone wearing an Ubuntu t-shirt on the train between Trowbridge and Bath the other day.
