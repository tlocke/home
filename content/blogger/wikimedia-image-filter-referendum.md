Now and again I make an edit to Wikipedia and Wiktionary, which makes me eligible to vote in the [Image Filter Referendum](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image_filter_referendum/en). I read [the debate](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Talk:Image_filter_referendum/en) that's going on, but I don't really have strong views. I suppose I don't really see the need for an image filter. I'm sort of in the 'if it ain't broke don't fix it' camp, and I'm vaguely concerned about creating a system that could be used for censorship, even though Wikipedia would only use it for self-censorship. Well, I've voted now, and I've been given a receipt. It's actually a PGP message, and I'm not sure what it means because I don't have the private key to decrypt it.
