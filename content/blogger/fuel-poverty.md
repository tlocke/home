I've noticed the phrase 'fuel poverty' being used. I find this phrase infuriating because it implies that someone could be wealthy in every way apart from fuel, which is absurd (assuming we're talking about the UK in the present day). It also implies that someone could be in poverty in every way apart from fuel, which is equally absurd.  
  
Don't misunderstand me, I agree that poverty is a problem, just don't call it 'fuel poverty'.  
  
I'm not saying this just to be picky. Calling it 'fuel poverty' implies that fuel is too expensive and must somehow be made cheaper. Calling it poverty however, allows us other options, such as keeping fuel's high price but at the same time to stop taxing poor people.
