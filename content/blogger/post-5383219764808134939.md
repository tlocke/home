I also wanted to mention that for my domain provider I am unable to point my DNS to www.own-id.com.  
  
Godaddy.com requires that I point to an IP Address. So I have pointed to: 82.211.77.143  
  
Hopefully this is a static IP Address, if not then my domains will not point to own-id.com if the IP address of the domain changes.
