A wiki, by definition is collaborative. a non-collaborative wiki is a paradox surely?  
  
I understand where you coming from, but perhaps there should be another term for what you are doing, which essentially is generating web content using wiki tools?  
  
I suggest "WIKI Without Any Wiki Alterability" which nicely forms the acronym WIKI WA WA. Job done.
