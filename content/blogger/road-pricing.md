I heard someone on the radio advocating road pricing. I'm in favour of this, so I've added an [article on road pricing](http://www.tlocke.org.uk/page/16) to the [Political Manifesto](http://www.tlocke.org.uk/page/0). My twist is that the money should go to maintenance of the road network, and any left over should be divided up equally between the population.
