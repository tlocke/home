[Queuing to get in.](http://twitter.com/t_locke/status/2598743463) It takes about an hour.

My nephews are really into Thomas The Tank Engine, so this caught my eye.

I hope you can make out the writing, dear reader.

You make your own mind up.

A touch self-agrandizing.

An animated salami sausage. This is part of a series of pieces where an animated piece of food is shown as if it's the animal it comes from. Eg. battered cod swimming in a fish bowl.

Now, someone who knows about art could tell me the painting that this uses.

This isn't a Banksy, it's a biologically accurate model of the AIDS virus.

See the note about the images of the virus in the media.

This made everyone laugh!

I'm disappointed that Banksy uses MS-Windows.

This animated mechanical riot police officer is disturbingly lifelike when you see him in the flesh.

The way we went through the museum, we saw this at the end.

Ironically, the biggest moral question is posed by the very existence of the exhibition, rather than its content. Graffiti is illegal, and yet here we are celebrating criminality. Would I mind if someone graffitied my house? Yes! Unless it was a Banksy, in which case I'd be rich. So should we change the law to make graffiti illegal \_unless\_ it adds monetary value? Well no, that would be ridiculous. Can someone tell me what my attitude to graffiti should be? Thank you.
