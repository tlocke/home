Went for a walk and put some extra bits on Open Streetmap. I took a snapshot of the map beforehand:

I've now added in things on the [route from the cottage to the Co-op](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=50.40913&lon=-4.67135&zoom=17&layers=M). There are quite a few unmapped areas, I'll add in some more tomorrow. I took a photo on the way to Restormel:

I can report that no sheep landed while I was in the vicinity.
