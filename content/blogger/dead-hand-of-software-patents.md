I've been moved to write the following to [my MP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westbury_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29) and some of my MEPs:  

> Andrew Murrison, Graham Watson, Neil Parish,  
>   
> I was concerned to hear that the Court of Appeal has ruled that patents should be allowed on software.

> The reason that software patents are so bad is that it's so difficult, time consuming and expensive to avoid violating them. One has to hire expensive patent lawyers etc. This is in contrast to copyright, where it's easy to avoid copying someone else's work. So I believe that copyright is adequate for people who want their software to be proprietary.
