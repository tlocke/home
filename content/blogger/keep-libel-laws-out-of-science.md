My friend Jonathan alerted me to the [Sense About Science campaign](http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/index.php/site/project/333/) to prevent libel law being used to stifle scientific debate. Jonathan writes:  

> The broadcaster and science journalist Simon Singh is being sued for libel by the British Chiropractic Association as a resulting calling their remedies 'bogus'. There is a campaign to support him and you can sign a petition.

I've
[signed the petition](http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/index.php/site/project/334)
because I believe freedom of speech is essential to the health of society. Some
may remember an [earlier post]({filename}limits-of-free-speech.md) on the
limits of freedom of speech where I quoted Noam Chomsky:  

> In brief, speech should be protected up to participation in imminent criminal action. So if you and I go into a store to rob it, and I say "shoot," that's not protected.  

Also, think of the money that'll be saved in lawyers' fees if we stop these unnecessary libel trials!
