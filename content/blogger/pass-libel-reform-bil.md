I've just emailed [my MP](http://skeptical-voter.org/wiki/index.php?title=Don_Foster) about the [Libel Reform Bill](http://www.libelreform.org/dontkillthebill?):  

> Hi Don, I'm aware that you're a supporter of libel reform in the UK and I'm writing to you as a constituent to ask you to take the necessary steps to ensure the bill is passed before the end of the parliamentary session. I'm concerned that the bill has been 'hijacked' by those seeking to impose press regulation, and I feel that it's important that the original intent of the bill remains intact.
