I hope this is [*fair dealing*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_dealing#Fair_dealing_in_the_United_Kingdom) of [this book cover](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ManPlus%281stEd%29.jpg).

It has a 50s feel to it. I like the descriptions of the protagonist's inner life. It seems incredible to us that such early machines could become conscious. However, he was on the right track...
