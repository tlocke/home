I've just got my polling card for the [Trowbridge Central Elections 10th July 2008](http://www.westwiltshire.gov.uk/index/council/democratic_processes_and_events/elections-voting/elections-forthcoming/trowbridge-central-100708.htm) but I can't find a list of who's standing, so I don't know how to vote. Can anyone help?
