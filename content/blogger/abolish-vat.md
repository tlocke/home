We should make sure that poor people don't have to pay tax. At the moment we pay means-tested benefits to the poor, while also charging them VAT. This is bad because it is bureaucratic and creates perverse incentives. Abolishing VAT would be funded by:

-   [CO2 Tax](http://www.tlocke.org.uk/page/co2-tax-back)
-   [Ending the drugs prohibition](http://www.tlocke.org.uk/page/end-the-drugs-prohibition)
-   Legalizing prostitution.
-   [The EU unilaterally removing all protectionist policies.](http://www.tlocke.org.uk/page/political-manifesto)
-   Paying less in state benefits because the cost of living would be lower.
