The thing is that once you've committed in Mercurial, the idea is that it stays there forever. In Git, the idea is that commits only become immutable when it's made public.  
  
That means that with Git you can look back over the history and change it so that it makes more sense. With Mercurial you're stuck with a replay of how it happened.
