I heard someone on the radio saying of the England cricket team, 'I think the team don't mind that their success isn't attracting media attention, they're just happy to get on with the job', or words to that effect.

For most jobs that's true, but the aim of a professional sports person is to entertain the masses, which entails attracting media attention. So from a business point of view it's a problem that people aren't paying attention. Of course, if they're enjoying themselves then I'd argue that that's an end in itself.
