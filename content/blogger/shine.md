Another of Janos's great books. Shine is a collection of 'optimistic near-future' sci-fi short stories. The fantastic Alastair Reynolds has a story in there, which lived up to his high standards. Of the people I hadn't heard of the two that stood out were Kay Kenyon with Castoff World and Madeline Ashby with Ishin.  
  
Castoff World stuck in my mind because of the atmosphere evoked by the pair adrift in the sea with the nano-swarm. Kenyon brilliantly describes their world.  
  
In Ishin we've got an exciting but sensitive tale, which again makes me want to read more of Ashby's work. I didn't like the fact the an otherwise sympathetic character happened to be a patent troll!
