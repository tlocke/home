Thanks to Bill for organizing a visit to [Cleveland Pools](http://www.clevelandpools.org.uk/) lido in Bath on Saturday. It's run-down and disused, but there's a group trying to restore it. There's a problem of attracting people to it in the off-season. I suggested using it as a skating rink in winter, and a skate-park in spring and autumn.
