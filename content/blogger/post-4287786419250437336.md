No single overarching philosophy is possible. Even in maths. Came to this insight while listening to ABBA. Lyrics are a bit square. Other people have different feelings and different approaches. Diversity.  
  
Talks of being inspired by trains, and the grand achievements of humanity. I do to, but don't like to pierce that illusion.
