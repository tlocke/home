The other Saturday there was off-road karting for a stag day. I got a lift to the karting with two geo-caching devotees, and they stopped off by the Severn Estuary to find a cache.

I took a photo of the karting track just as we were about to leave. I know, I should have got some photos of the actual racing :-)
