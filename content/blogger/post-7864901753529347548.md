Hi,  
I just tried own-id.com, but didn't get very far. I added the CNAME but was prompted to 'enter the OpenId you got from your provider.' I have no clue what to do from here, so I tried with my email address giving a 1537 fatal transport error, then tried the address which throws me a nullpointer at ConsumerManager.java:601  
What to do?!
