I resisted making this post for some time, for it reveals the petty and authoritarian side of my nature. I travel by train **a lot**. Although [Mussolini didn't actually make the trains run on time](http://www.snopes.com/history/govern/trains.asp), these are the things he should have done:  

-   **When waiting for a train, spread out evenly along the platform.** I always see everyone trying to board the train through the same door, forming a massive queue. If all the entrances to the train were used evenly, the train could actually leave on time.
-   Wait for people to get off before getting on.
-   While you're waiting for people to get off, queue parallel to the train and for heaven's sake leave a generous gap to let people get off.
-   When you get on the train, walk along to the middle of the carriage **AND DON'T DAWDLE** then find a seat. If there isn't a seat, then stand as near to the middle of the carriage as you can.
-   Above all, [don't loiter in the vestibule](http://twitter.com/t_locke/status/2152235096).
