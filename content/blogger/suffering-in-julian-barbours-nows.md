My question is simple. If time were stopped, would people carry on feeling the same sensation as when time stopped? Or would they stop feeling anything? Or some other answer?

I tell you why I ask. I was going for a jog and it was really cold. I was cold, aching and just wanted to get home. I thought to myself, if time were to stop, would I carry on feeling like this for eternity? In fact is there another me in one of [Julian Barbour's Nows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Barbour) that will always feel like I did?

To put the question another way, if time were stopped, distance would still exist, but motion would not. Is sensation like distance or like motion?
