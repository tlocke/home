The point is that there arent free markets anywhere - people who advocate them ignore the fact that they never will be.  
  
The EU still prevents poor African countires form exporting produce to us by using tarrfs - ditto the americans who hugely subsidiase grain.  
  
As I understand it, Ireland exported food right throughout the potatol famine, as Africa does now.
