Yesterday I lost against Paddy \*again\*, 2 games to 1.  
  
Backhand let me down as ever. Paddy's main tactic was to hit high and long to my backhand, then I'd do a lame return. If it actually made it over the net he'd just smash it. Then if I was in a position to return it with my forehand, he'd do a drop shot just over the net on the opposite side of the court to where I was. This is new. He's got pretty good at those drop shots now.  
  
Also, I have to say that Paddy's returns were awesome against my smashes. I don't know how he does it.  
  
Fitness let me down as well. Towards the end of the third game I barely had the strength to hold the racquet. I was utterly exhausted. That night I slept for 11 hours straight.  
  
Just in case Paddy reads this: [I'll be back!]{style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"}
