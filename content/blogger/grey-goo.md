What's the difference between a nanobot and a virus? The answer from the Science Cafe talk at the Raven on Monday is that a virus is biological and a nanobot artificial. So I take this to mean there's no intrinsic difference, it's just how they come into being. This has implications for the grey goo idea. The question is; why hasn't the grey goo already happened with viruses (evolved nanobots)?
