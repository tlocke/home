Hi Tony. I'm the author...I was trawling through blog hits on 'Last Light' and found your post.  
  
First of all, thanks for name-checking the book, I'm glad you enjoyed it. I'd dearly love to think market-forces will dive in and bail us out at the eleventh hour, and they may well, but I feel, it's madness to wait around and hope that will happen.  
  
Personally, I'm no big fan of free-market capitalism, nor of the sort of decisions this corrupted paradigm spits out; decisions which mostly are about salary bonuses 6 months down the line, than they are about long term strategic planning.
