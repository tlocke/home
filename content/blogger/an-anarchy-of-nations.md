Walking through Green Park Station in Bath, a man from the Leave the EU campaign saw me and proffered a leaflet. I said that I was in favour of remaining in the EU. He asked why and I explained that at the European level we've got democracy at the moment, but if we were to leave the EU we'd go back to having Europe as an anarchy of nations (two world wars etc). He said, 'well if you follow that logic we'd have a world government!', I said, 'yes we should have a world government', at which he recoiled and gave me up as a hopeless case.
