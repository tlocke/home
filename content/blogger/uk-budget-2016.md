Looking at the [main points](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35819797) of the UK 2016 budget, I'm pleased that the Chancellor is cutting spending, but I'm not happy about where he's cutting it. Here are some comments on the specific items:  
  

-   *Abolition of Class 2 National Insurance contributions.* **Good.** National Insurance is a [regressive tax](http://neilharding.blogspot.co.uk/2014/07/national-insurance-it-regressive-nature.html), and should be abolished entirely.
-   *The threshold at which people pay 40% income tax will rise from £42,385 to £45,000 in April 2017.* **Bad.** If there's money to spare for tax cuts it should be used to cut the taxes of the poor.
-   T*ax-free personal allowance to rise from £11,000 to £11,500.* **Good.** This is cutting taxes for the poor, which tackles inequality.
-   *Capital Gains Tax to be cut.* **Neither.** Capital Gains should be taxed at exactly the same rate as income.
-   *Annual Isa limit to rise from £15,240 to £20,000.* **Bad.** ISAs should be abolished. They're bureaucratic and the money should instead go to abolishing taxes on the poor.
-   *New "lifetime" Isa for the under-40s.* **Bad.** As above.
-   *New state-backed savings scheme.* **Bad.** As above.
