I helped my dad clear out his garage before he moved house. We found a pentagonal box that I'd made for him and my mother when I was about 13. We used it as the family's laundry box for years.

Father has recently shaved his beard off. He's growing it back again now.

Here my father holds up a tile. A long time ago, he made a table with those tiles forming the table-top. It was a good table, and when the family needed some money, he sold it. I can just about remember the table.
