Just recently my friend Zoe was moving house and she had a stack of books that people could take, as she was going to throw them away. I took [The Watcher]({filename}/blogger/watcher.md) and Nick Hornby's About A Boy. I saw the film ages ago and liked it. I like the book even better. The book is more complete and coherent. The film has the best ending though. It's brilliant the way the boy casts doubt on the Hugh Grant character's choice of trainers. Hugh Grant rolls his eyes saying, 'I've created a monster'.  
  
I've lent the book out, it's one of those books you know that everyone is going to like.
