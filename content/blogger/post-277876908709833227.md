nice to see i'm not the only one fighting against tony's determination to free the world's trade!  
  
free trade is a good idea(l) but impossible to achieve and - like communism - not neccessarily a good idea to attempt.  
  
corporations act in their own best interest and governments (are supposed to) work in our best interest. therefore, you will always get conflict between free markets and legislative governing.  
  
what we need is govenment that is not paid for by business and not afraid to upset us (ie. the opposite of what we have now). this is the first stage.  
  
the second stage is to understand the effects of what the markets are doing (ie. starving the Irish) and whether legislation needs to be bought in to counteract that and, if that happens, what the consequences will be.
