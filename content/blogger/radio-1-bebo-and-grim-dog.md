Listening to [Switch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Switch), I heard Nick 'Grimmy' Grimshaw, mention [Bebo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bebo) loads of times, without mentioning any other social networking site. It seems like Radio 1 have done a deal with Bebo; Grim Dog is promoting links to Bebo on the R1 site.
