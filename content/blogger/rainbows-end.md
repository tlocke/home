A Fire Upon The Deep and A Deepness In The Sky by Vernor Vinge are among my top sci-fi books. I borrowed Vinge's [Rainbows End](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbows_End) from Janos, a novel set here on Earth in the near future. The implicit predictions contained in the descriptions of the lifestyles and technology are interesting. The interactions between the characters are tightly drawn, and a creditable attempt is made to give depth to the personalities.

The plot is highly complex. I'm not good at following plots. Raymond Chandler is great to read, but utterly impossible to follow. I'm sure there are people out there that can follow every swerve and loop in Rainbows End, but I'm not one of them.  
  
I'll continue to look out for Vinge's work.
