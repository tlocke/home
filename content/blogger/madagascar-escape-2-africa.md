I visited Matt in Oxford last weekend. The day before he said, 'Tony, some friends are going to the cinema in the afternoon, are you up for that?'. It turned out to be his 5 year old god son's birthday party! [Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madagascar_2) was actually very good. It's not something I'd have seen normally, but I'm really glad I did.
