It's not a great look, Tony. But it does have the distinction of being the most designed bit of your site so far!  
  
What I like about favicons is that however much you refresh the page or purge your cache they never show up immediately. You get frustrated, check you've done it right, check again and then give up. Then after a few hours you look at the site again and there it is!
