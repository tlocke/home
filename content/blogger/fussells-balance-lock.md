My dad and I went to see [Fussell's Balance Lock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorset_and_Somerset_Canal#Construction):

Okay, it's hard to make out from the photo, but the two deep bits on each side are where the canal boats would have gone up and down in the caissons.  
  
Looking at this artefact of industrial archaeology prompted me to quote from Shelley's Ozymandias, 'look upon my works ye mighty, and despair'. My dad thought I'd just made it up.  
  
We went for a walk around the area, and I [mapped it](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=51.25369&lon=-2.38137&zoom=16) on OpenStreetmap. This is a memorial shelter designed by [Lutyens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Lutyens).

Below is a photo of me outside the local shop in Mells.
