Reading [To The Hermitage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Bradbury) was
like listening to an extremely erudite raconteur who happens to have an
obsession with Diderot. I learnt an awful lot about Diderot and the other
Enlightenment figures, all imparted in a gossipy, conversational style. My
ignorance of Diderot means I've probably missed some of the clever references
in the book, but I've been inspired to read Rameau's Nephew, where the Moi and
Lui come from.
