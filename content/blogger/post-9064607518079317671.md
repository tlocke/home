Insulation is certainly one of the most important factors, but I would of thought any product that gives ongoing savings is worthwhile, such as solar panels and ground source heat pumps? For that matter, using the best insulation you can should be a priority - if you compare the thermal conductivity or r-values you can tell what the best product is
