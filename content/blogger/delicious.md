It seems a good idea to store your bookmarks on the web, then you always have them with you, whatever computer you're on. I had a look at bookmarking websites some time ago, and for some reason decided they weren't that good. Sarah at work got me thinking about them again so I signed up to [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/). It's working well so far!
