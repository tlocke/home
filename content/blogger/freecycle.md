Everyone seems to know about [FreeCycle](http://uk.freecycle.org/) except me. It's a brilliant idea. If you want to get rid of useable stuff, don't take it to the tip, post it on FreeCycle and someone who wants it will come and collect it. I've done this with my unwanted TalkTalk modem. We'll see how it goes.  
  
Btw, my car still hasn't sold. Maybe FreeCycle it...
