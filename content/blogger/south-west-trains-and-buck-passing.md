The chocolate / crisp vending machine at Bath Spa train station took my pound coin. I've got a Pavlovian reaction to being on the platform, I buy a Bounty bar. This time it took my pound coin and without thinking I lost another Â£1.10 trying to dislodge the first pound coin. The notice on the machine said not to complain to the station staff if the machine wasn't working, so I complained to the station staff. They said it wasn't anything to do with them (South West Trains). However, they were pretty good about it and put an 'out of order' note on the machine.  
  
It seems to me that this is a microcosm of the buck passing you see on the railways as a whole. The rail companies should take full responsibility for everything that happens on the railways, from vending machines to accidents. To achieve this, the train operating companies should own Network Rail.
