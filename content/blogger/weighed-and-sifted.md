Atonement was a sublime book. [Seeing the film]({filename}atonement.md)
afterwards was more enjoyable as a result.  
  
[Saturday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_%28novel%29) lived up to my high expectations. I don't know for sure, but I'd guess that in these two books the world that is described is very different from McEwan's background. I supposed all books are a rarefied distillation of some sort, but McEwan's are particularly subtle and well balanced.  
  
Yes, balance is the word, everything's weighed and sifted.  
  
Which cleverly brings me to yesterday's pancake cooking. I used a [Delia Smith recipe](http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/database/basilpancakswithsuga_66226.shtml), but my friend Jo stepped in and prepared the actual mixture, leaving me to do the fun part of, ahem, tossing. I feel a bit guilty for inviting people over and then getting them to do the cooking. It's not the first time it's happened.  
  
Afterwards we watched Emma's DVD [Stardust](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stardust_%282007_film%29), a polished and surprisingly funny summer-blockbuster. Thank you Emma!
