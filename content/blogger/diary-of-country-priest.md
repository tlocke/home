By the end, [Diary Of A Country Priest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diary_of_a_Country_Priest) had moved me to tears. It's a film with a great deal of depth, so it's hard to take in in one go. When watching a film I first try and identify the baddies and goodies. Of course, if the film is any good, then as in life, it's not so easy to separate people into goodies and baddies. In fact, coming to write about the film, I don't know what to make of it.

What about the doctor, Dr Delbende, that committed suicide? What are we to make of that? The doctor was an atheist, and a friend of the Priest of Torcy. The Priest of Ambricourt (the priest of the title, hereafter the PoA) went to see the doctor for a diagnosis, and detected that Belbende had a deeply wounded soul. When the Priest of Torcy talked to the PoA about Belbende after he died, the PoA said that hearing it gave him the most pain he had been in in his life. Why? Was it because he felt guilty because he perhaps could have helped? I don't know. If you have any clues, let me know.
