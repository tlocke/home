This is the box with all my old physics stuff in. A lot of wonderful books that I never properly understood. I wish I could spend some more time understanding it. I wasn't very good at physics, but could understand enough to find it interesting.  
  
Looking back over the folder of work, I'm impressed that anyone (let alone me) could understand all the gobbledegook, and yet at one time I did understand things like solving Schroedinger's wave equation for a potential well.  
  
I could never understand anything through lectures, I always preferred reading books. The lectures told you what was on the syllabus though. In the second year my friend Chris was a year ahead of me, and he gave me his notes on the second year and I didn't go to any lectures. I did well that year, better than the final year when I had to go to lectures!
