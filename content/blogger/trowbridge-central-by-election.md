I live in Trowbridge Central, and tomorrow there's a by-election for the Town Council and the District Council. Maybe I've not looked hard enough, but I couldn't find any info about the election on the [Town Council website](http://www.trowbridge.gov.uk/viewcontent.asp?id=137). I'd have expected to see a list of the candidates at the very least.  
  
The parties themselves are very varied in the information they provide. The Conservatives had [quite a long piece](http://www.westwiltsconservatives.com/) on their candidate, and a [useful list of by-elections](http://www.westwiltsconservatives.com/page.php?pid=37). The [Liberal Democrats](http://www.wiltshirelibdems.org.uk/pages/wwdc.html) had nothing, and neither did [the greens](http://southwest.greenparty.org.uk/elections).  
  
Please correct me if you know different.  
  
Who am I going to vote for? I'd like to reward the Conservatives for actually communicating with the electorate, but I'll probably vote Liberal Democrat.
