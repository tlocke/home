The UK energy minister Charles Hendry has called for (among other undesirable things) a [capacity payment for low carbon electricity](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/8111274/More-incentives-needed-for-nuclear-says-Energy-Minister-Charles-Hendry.html). Capacity payments are a market distortion that increases the cost of electricity. The way it works is that you're paid for being available to generate electricity, even if it's not used. It's being put forward by pro-nuclear lobbyists who know that they can't compete with other energy sources on a level playing field, and so are trying rig legislation in their favour.
