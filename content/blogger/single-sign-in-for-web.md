One of the tiresome things about the web is remembering so many different usernames and passwords, and having to enter them all the time. Today I just signed up for an [OpenId](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID) with [MyOpenId.com](https://www.myopenid.com/). It'll mean that for participating web sites I'll only have to sign in once. Great!  
  
There are a lot more opportunities that arise from having a web identity. I haven't really digested the implications yet...
