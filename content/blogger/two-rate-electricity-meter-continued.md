Good Energy have replied to
[my question]({filename}two-rate-electricity-meter.md) about a two rate meter. I can have one for free if I commit to staying with Good Energy for at least two years. The only thing is that [comparing the tariffs](http://www.good-energy.co.uk/PDF/ge_domestic_ref08.pdf), the night rate is a lot lower, but the standing charge and day rate is a bit higher. Can someone who's good at maths tell me which is the cheapest?
