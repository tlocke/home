It doesn't arrive until about Thursday, but I bought a
 [Giant Trance X 5](http://www.giant-bicycles.com/EN-GB/bikes/mountain/2434/32482/zoom/) today. Don't ask me how much it was, it was extravagant, but now the die is cast. I needed to make my mind up because my brother needs his bike back next weekend. I'm excited!
