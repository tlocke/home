Andy's pointed me to this Economist [article](http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8380592) on the ethical buying of food. There are several different issues involved:

-   **CO~2~ emissions.** Many people attempt to buy food that has caused the minimum CO2 pollution. But as the article points out, this is incredibly difficult. I buy groceries from an organic box scheme that doesn't allow air freight. The best solution though is to have a [carbon dioxide tax](http://www.tlocke.org.uk/co2-tax-back).
-   **Health of the person eating the food.** Here it seems that organic labelling does its job. With organic, you're eating food that's been tried and tested for thousands of years. Where's the benefit to the consumer in ingesting novel chemical compounds?

Next stop Bath Spa. The other points will have to wait!
