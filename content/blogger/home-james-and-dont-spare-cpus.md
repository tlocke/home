One of my nephews is about 1 and a half years old. I commented to my brother that by the time the nephew is of driving age, most cars will be driven by robots. He strongly disagreed.  
  
I now put this to everyone I meet:  
  
[By 2023, more cars will be driven by computers than by humans.]{style="font-weight: bold;"}  
  
Everyone's disagreed so far. Including Toby, Jess and Janos at work. And Bill and Doug.  
  
Please add a comment saying if you agree or disagree.
