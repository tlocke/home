The government plans to compel us in the UK to [buy smart meters](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8042716.stm). The arguments for it are that:  

-   It'll save the electricity companies money because meter readers wouldn't have to go out and read meters.
-   It'll save customers money, because more accurate measurement leads to energy savings.

I object to the compulsion aspect of this policy, I think the customer should be free to choose the type of meter they have. The supplier can publish two tariffs, one for a conventional meter, and another for a smart meter, and the customer can choose which one they think will be best for them.
