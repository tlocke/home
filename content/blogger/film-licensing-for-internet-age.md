Have you seen [Sintel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRsGyueVLvQ)? Apart from being an excellent short animated film, it's licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) licence. That means that it's an Open Source film, nobody holds a monopoly over it. I hope and expect that this type of licensing will become more popular, as it has with software. Hurray, licensing for the internet age!
