The Mosques of Istanbul, Handel's Messiah, illuminated manuscripts, Aretha Franklin and Sun Ra, the printing press, feasts, festivals, collosseums, cathedrals, pyramids and terracotta armies... it's astonishing what people can do when they have a God who's bigger than they are. Religion doesn't only bring out the worst in humans.
