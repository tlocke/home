I'm forever listening to Alphaville's Forever Young. It's a moving song, with an elegaic quality. One thing jars though in the lyrics. Look at this:  

> Some are like water, some are like the heat  
> Some are a melody and some are the beat  
> Sooner or later they all will be gone  
> Why don't they stay young  
> It's so hard to get old without a cause  
> I don't want to perish like a fading horse  
> Youth is like diamonds in the sun  
> And diamonds are forever  
> So many adventures couldn't happen today  
> So many songs we forgot to play  
> So many dreams are swinging out of the blue  
> We let them come true

I think the line: 'I don't want to perish like a fading horse' can be improved. I've tried to think of a better line myself but can't come up with anything. Do you have any suggestions?
