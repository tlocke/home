Well, UK trains are among the cheapest in Europe if you include subsidies.  
  
But the main thing is that privatization only works if it's done well. I think UK rail was botched, so we're not really seeing all the benefit we could.  
  
I think you're right on the 'bailing out' point, we shouldn't bail out private companies.
