Kazim was over for the weekend, and on Saturday we went on a walk to [Avebury](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=51.42823&lon=-1.85406&zoom=16&layers=B000FTF) with my brother and my dad. It was cold, but we had a hot chocolate at the Red Lion at the end.

When Kazim and I got back to my house there was still some evening left, so we hired Knowing from Blockbuster.

Exciting all the way through, with a twist at the end. A lot of biblical themes and imagery. Adam and Eve at the end for example. The Rapture came to mind. It's well known in America, for example in Paramore's [Ignorance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignorance_%28song%29) Hayley Williams sings:  

> It's not a war no, it's not a rapture

The Rapture is not so well known outside the USA though.

The film makers reconcile their religious beliefs with modern science, by giving the role of God to aliens. I'm exasperated by this attitude. We've got to take responsibility ourselves. Jesus won't save us, and neither will aliens.  
  
I remember standing by the cooker and saying something slightly blasphemous. My mum was concerned that I'd receive divine retribution. I replied that if God did strike me down, as least we'd know he actually existed, and mankind would have learned something useful.  
  
Despite being an atheist, I still feel very uncomfortable blaspheming, it's the result of a religious upbringing. As Nietzsche says:  

> God is Dead; but given the way of men, there may still be caves for thousands of years in which his shadow will be shown. And we â€” we still have to vanquish his shadow, too.

I don't think I've vanquished his shadow. If things are going well for me, I still feel that God will punish me for my hubris.
