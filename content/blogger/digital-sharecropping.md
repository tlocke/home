This has a nice rhetorical ring to it, but is wrong because it's an analogy between physical goods and information. Property and information obey completely different rules, so you can't reason by analogy between them.  
  
If someone makes a copy of some information I hold, I don't lose anything, but the other person gains something. However, if someone takes my cake, then I lose it, and the other person gains it.
