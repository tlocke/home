Moving, emotional, satisfying. I particularly like taking ideas seriously, and this film does that with the protagonist's outwardly odd behaviour. I know I always refer back to [The Fabric of Reality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:The_Fabric_of_Reality), but Lars acts as if he's applying the approach of David Deutsch. I'll explain. Lars' mind has come up with the idea of the doll, and rather than dismissing it, he takes it seriously. In this way a resolution is inevitable, one way or the other.
