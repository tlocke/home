I've just responded to the consultation on the [20 mph speed limit in Oldfield Park](http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/services/streets-and-highway-maintenance/road-safety/traffic-schemes/creating-neighbourhoods-where-p), voting in favour of it. In the comments section I said that I'd like to see more zebra crossings, particularly at the junction between Livingstone Road and Brougham Hayes.
