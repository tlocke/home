Went for a stroll this morning, [and mapped a new road](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=50.40913&lon=-4.67135&zoom=17&layers=M). Finished reading [Herland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herland_%28novel%29), by Charlotte Perkins Gilman. Herland is a feminist utopia, an undiscovered realm populated entirely by women. It's easy to mock utopias, but they're much harder to write about than dystopias, so I admire anyone who has a go. The wondrous place is revealed to us through the eyes of 3 male characters, of varying degrees of masculinity.

I'd prefer to live in a Gilman novel than a Dostoevsky one!
