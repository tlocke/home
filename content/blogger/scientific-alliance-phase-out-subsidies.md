I read [an article](http://www.scientific-alliance.org/scientific-alliance-newsletter/phasing-out-subsidies) and was moved to write the following email:  

> Dear Scientific Alliance,  
>   
> I read with interest your news letter entitled Phasing Out Subsidies:  
>   
> http://www.scientific-alliance.org/scientific-alliance-newsletter/phasing-out-subsidies  
>   
> While I agree that subsidies for renewables should be phased out, surely subsidies for all sources of energy are equally bad. For example, why is there no mention of the Â£2.3bn annual subsidy that nuclear power receives?
