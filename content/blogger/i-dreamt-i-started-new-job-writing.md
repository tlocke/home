I dreamt I started a new job writing software. They didn't have a computer for me, but eventually they found a really old 286 and an old-fashioned printer. I was worried that I wouldn't be able to do the job working on such hardware. Nobody was very nice to me.  
  
For some reason I had to travel to another city, and I was driven there at high speed along a dual-carriageway in a go-cart by Jonathan. I remember thinking that we were going to crash and die, and kept telling Jonathan to slow down. We made it in the end.  
  
Then I was house-sitting and a middle-aged woman came to inspect the house. I was eating something like liquorice root, and couldn't talk properly so I spat it out in the garden. It looked like dog poo, and I hoped she wouldn't notice it when she inspected the garden.
