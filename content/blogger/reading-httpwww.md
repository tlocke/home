Reading <http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/conformancing> reminded me of a similar thought I had. There are plenty of things that are socially unacceptable, but that are not morally unacceptable. I think that behaviour that fits into this category is disquieting because it implies that the person might disregard *all* social norms, including those that are morally important.
