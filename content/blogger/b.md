I've written to B&Q:  

> Looking at [Thermawrap General Purpose Wrap](http://www.diy.com/diy/jsp/bq/nav/nav.jsp?action=detail&fh_secondid=9273745&fh_view_size=6&fh_start_index=6&fh_eds=%3f&fh_location=%2f%2fcatalog01%2fen_GB%2fcategories%3C%7B10082%7D%2fcategories%3C%7B10088%7D%2fcategories%3C%7B9231012%7D%2fspecificationsProductType%3dloft_insulation&fh_refview=lister&ts=1228683423451&isSearch=false) on your website, it says: [Thermal resistance 1.455mÂ²k/w in Wall Lining installation]{style="font-style: italic;"}. Since its thickness is quoted as 4mm, this would give a thermal conductivity of \~ 0.00275 W/mK. Expanded polystyrene has a thermal conductivity of 0.033 W/mk, so are you saying that Thermawrap is a \~12 times better insulator than polystyrene?  

I'll let you know if it's really true!
