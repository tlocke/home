I'm feeling sad. Can't concentrate to read a book. It's a passing thing, and I'll feel silly at writing it later on.  
  
The awkward turtle has seen plenty of action. Knowing only a small amount of French seems to guarantee that I generate at least one profoundly awkward moment during each conversation.  
  
When I arrived at the flat, the owner asked in French if I planned on visiting the local Ch√¢teaux. I confidently replied in French, 'no, it is me only'. She adopted a WTF expression.  
The thing is, I thought she had asked, 'will you be having any visitors to the house?'  
  
There are a thousand incidents like this, and many more to come.

I think I have ordered moules a la creme, a bier and a glass of water. Success!
