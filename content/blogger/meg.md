On Christmas Eve we went to The Canal Tavern. Even on the second busiest night of the year it was fairly empty! It was a nice surprise to see Claire and James's new puppy, Meg.

Springer spaniels are fantastic dogs. I really miss our Springer, Roger.  
  
A good thing about Christmas Eve is that you see people you haven't seen for ages. Stu turned up, and it was like he'd never been away.
