If you didn't scope this at a module level (or provide some way of renaming variables on import) then either code reuse becomes very hit and miss, or people will be reduced to mangling variable names (e.g. inserting a java style package as a prefix for all).  
  
Don't deny that all other types of scoping have issues.
