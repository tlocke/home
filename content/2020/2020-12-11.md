Title: Trollope describes the Overton window

I'd picked up [Phineas Redux](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18640) at a
charity shop and was about to read it when I read somewhere that it was
important to read [Phineas Finn](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18000) first.

[![Phineas Finn](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/Phineas_Finn.jpg/289px-Phineas_Finn.jpg "By Anthony Trollope/Virtue Publishers - Phineas Finn (free pdf from Archive.org), Public Domain ")](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Phineas_Finn.jpg#/media/File:Phineas_Finn.jpg)

Reading Phineas Finn, I came across the following speech:

> "...Many who before regarded legislation on the subject as chimerical, will
> now fancy that it is only dangerous, or perhaps not more than difficult. And
> so in time it will come to be looked on as among the things possible, then
> among the things probable;â€”and so at last it will be ranged in the list of
> those few measures which the country requires as being absolutely needed.
> That is the way in which public opinion is made."

Which struck me as a good way of describing the
[Overton Window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window).
