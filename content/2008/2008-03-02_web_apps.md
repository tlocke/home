Title: Web Apps

<p>This is how I'd like various web apps to work.</p>
<h3>Common</h3>
<ul>
<li>Should support <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID">OpenId</a>.</li></ul>
<h3>Wiki</h3>
<ul>
<li>The URLs to the pages would be constructed in accordance with <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/tlocke.org.uk/tlocke/4">DesigningURLs</a>. Each page would be assigned a serial number. This number would never change. There would be no renaming of URLs.</li>
<li>It should be possible to edit the raw HTML.</li></ul>
<h3>Bookmarking</h3>
<ul>
<li>When a new URL is added, the default title should be the title found in the markup (&lt;title&gt; element in HTML)</li>
<li>Clicking on a link should open it in a new tab</li></ul>
