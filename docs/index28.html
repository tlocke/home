<p>Hi, I've just received my council tax bill, and I wondered if there was a paperless billing option? Eg. the bill could be emailed out, and the accompanying booklet could be online.</p>

<p>I rate Stross very highly as his what-if's and settings are wonderfully creative, while his writing style is often darkly humorous - a fun approach in a genre that often tends towards overly serious tones.  </p>

            <p>Palimpsest is the last story of Wireless, a collection of short stories by Charles Stross. Janos recommended Stross. In fact he did more than that, he presented me with a plastic bag filled with sci-fi books, one of which was Wireless!  </p>

            <p>Your absolutely right, price goes up, people buy less. But its not linear, and its bounded. If I were an economist I could explain better, I think its called elasticity of supply. Actually with energy its probably in-elasticity of supply.  </p>
