    <p>Normally I read all the manifestos before voting, but this time I don't feel the need. Here's my summary of the parties:  </p>
<h4>Labour</h4>
<p>Gordon Brown has made it clear that to get Britain's economy on its feet he'd continue wildly taxing and spending. I disagree with Brown, and agree with the Conservatives that we need to pay off our debt. I think this is such an important difference that I find myself unable to vote Labour.</p>
<h4>Conservative</h4>
<p>I think it's fantastic that they're against raising the National Insurance tax, I'm all for stopping taxing the poor. I also support their economic policy of cutting public spending, and reducing the debt as quickly as possible. I'm appalled by the Tory EU euro-phobia. Why can't they all be like Ken Clarke?</p>
<h4>Liberal Democrats</h4>
<p>I really like the Lib Dem policy of raising income tax threshold. I wish they'd go further and <a href="http://www.polifesto.com/policies/16/">stop taxing the poor</a> entirely. Electoral reform is a key aim of the Lib Dems, as it is for me. I'm <a href="http://www.polifesto.com/policies/3/">in favour of range voting</a>. I'm a euro-federalist, I want a united states of Europe as a step on the way to a <a href="http://www.polifesto.com/policies/11/">world government</a>!</p>
<p>What a shame that <a href="/trevor-carbins-just-one-minute-survey.html">my exchange with Trevor Carbin</a> revealed the liberal democrats to have some economically illiterate policies.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Labour: Fiscal incontinence. Conservatives: First past the post europhobes. Lib Dems: Better tax system, electoral reform, europhiles.</p>
<p>So on Thursday I'll be voting Liberal Democrat.</p>
