    <p><img alt="Marching" src="/images/2009/_MG_4125.jpg">  </p>
<p>Yesterday Bath marched to free Palestine. These are Russell How's superb photos of the day.  </p>
<p><img alt="Poster" src="/images/2009/protest-1.jpg">  </p>
<p>The placard I carried, enlarged so you can see the words.  </p>
<p>Incidentally, you can see a police officer in the background. The policing of the event was exceptionally good. Thanks, Avon &amp; Somerset Constabulary!  </p>
<p><img alt="Smoking" src="/images/2009/_MG_4438.jpg">  </p>
<p>Protesters walking past a resting busker.  </p>
<p><img alt="Dave's Poster" src="/images/2009/_MG_4417.jpg">  </p>
<p>Me holding Dave Andrews' placard. This is one of the problems with reporting. You see I didn't actually understand Dave's placard, and so avoided carrying it. Caught on camera it seems like I'm endorsing the message.  </p>
<p><img alt="On Shoulders" src="/images/2009/_MG_4409.jpg">  </p>
<p>Lots of protesters came with their kids.  </p>
<p><img alt="Holding Poster" src="/images/2009/_MG_4392.jpg">  </p>
<p>The march was something of tour of central Bath, stopping off at shops that the organizers say support Israel. Does M&amp;S really send money to Israel so that they can buy arms? Where am I going to buy my pants?  </p>
<p><img alt="Protesters" src="/images/2009/_MG_4304.jpg">  </p>
<p>I don't think I can write a caption for this.  </p>
<p><img alt="Onlookers" src="/images/2009/_MG_4380.jpg">  </p>
<p>Onlookers. Everyone was really friendly towards us. Many filmed us.  </p>
<p><img alt="Protesters" src="/images/2009/_MG_4344.jpg">  </p>
<p>This is a great shot, as it places the action firmly in Bath.  </p>
<p><img alt="Two Signs" src="/images/2009/_MG_4331.jpg">  </p>
<p>Russell's juxtaposition of signs. Incidentally, Russ was everywhere at once with his camera. I'd see him in the distance, perched on a litter bin, then turn round to see him at my elbow. A peace-loving ninja.  </p>
<p><img alt="War Poster" src="/images/2009/_MG_4215.jpg">  </p>
<p>Well, I was probably in a minority on the march in thinking that war <em>is</em> sometimes justified.  </p>
<p><img alt="Free Palestine" src="/images/2009/_MG_4208.jpg">  </p>
<p>Now this was outside one of the two Starbucks in Bath. We were told that money from Starbucks' customers goes to buy Israeli arms. Is that true? If I catch the Uni bus, I'll often pop in for a hot chocolate while I'm waiting. Not any more.<br>
<img alt="Posters" src="/images/2009/_MG_4193.jpg">  </p>
<p>I believe this is outside Starbucks too.  </p>
<p><img alt="Protesters" src="/images/2009/_MG_4150.jpg">  </p>
<p>A supporter of the Israeli action walked through the protesters shouting, 'I support Israel! I support Israel!'. There was good-natured applause from the protesters, admiring her courage, if not her message.  </p>
<p><img alt="Loud Hailer" src="/images/2009/_MG_4105.jpg">  </p>
<p>The leader of the march in full voice. Congratulations to the organizers, it was very well done.</p>
