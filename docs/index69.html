            <p>Somehow I already knew the basic idea behind Ender's Game. The idea reached me by word of mouth; I was infected by the meme! Then one day I was discussing the meme with Janos, who knew the book and lent it to me.  </p>
<p>Ender's Game did not disappoint. Perhaps the …</p>

            <p>Moving, emotional, satisfying. I particularly like taking ideas seriously, and this film does that with the protagonist's outwardly odd behaviour. I know I always refer back to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:The_Fabric_of_Reality">The Fabric of Reality</a>, but Lars acts as if he's applying the approach of David Deutsch. I'll explain. Lars' mind has come up …</p>

            <p>Food prices are rising, the poor risk hunger, what should governments do?  </p>
<p>Some advocate price controls. The problem is that if prices are kept artificially low, the food business won't be so profitable and supply will decrease.  </p>
