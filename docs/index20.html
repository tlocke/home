            <p>I like post-apocalyptic fiction, so Zoe recommended Justin Cronin's The Passage. Charlotte had borrowed it, so she gave it to me. It's a fairly long book, but very readable. Somewhat of a distance was put between the book and me by the colloquial, American, 'soccer mom' style. Also, hints of …</p>

            <p>Some time ago, while visiting Matt in Oxford, we came back from his PhD celebrations and sat in his kitchen for a bit. One of his housemates was there and talked about Charles Dickens.
