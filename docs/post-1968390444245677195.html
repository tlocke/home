<p>A bit like the pre-crime department in Minority Report, DNA is foolproof unless someone tampers with the evidence. What it does is absolves the police of ever having to do any real work because once they have DNA the case is sewn up tight. We must be very wary of tools that the government can easily use for oppression.  </p>
<p>Oh, and CCTV is to protect property, not people. I used to live in a flat in town and someone was murdered outside my doorway one night. Nobody has ever been convicted despite it being one of the most heavily surveyed parts of the city.</p>
