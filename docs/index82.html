            <p>Often people use the phrase 'leave it to the free market'. This applies whether or not they are in favour of free markets. For example:  </p>
<ul>
<li>We're in a mess with global warming, and that's what happens when you leave it to the free market.</li>
<li>Look at all the problems with …</li></ul>

            <p>I've very grateful to my friend Bert for lending me the 'two books in one volume', The Godfather (see <a href="/godfather-is-anarchist.html">previous post</a>) and The Fortunate Pilgrim. In Pilgrim an italian immigrant brings up her family in pre-war USA, struggling through life's vicissitudes. It's triumph is to avoid descending into sentimentality.</p>

            <p>Many films (and some books) would be exceptionally boring if one of the characters had made a timely phone call to the police. The Godfather manages to make it plausible that the police aren't called. For one thing, the police may be controlled by another mafia family!  </p>

            <p>It's definitely an idea worth considering, though I wonder whether your caveat about incentivising the firearms market could be avoided by making this a one-off, week-long exercise rather than a permanent scheme. In that way there simply wouldn't be time to organise the import or manufacture of further weapons for …</p>
