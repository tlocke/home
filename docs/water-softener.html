    <p>The amount of limescale on the heat exchanger in my gas combi boiler should be reducing now, after 5 years of steady accumulation. My hope is that the house will use a bit less gas, and emit a bit less CO2.  </p>
<p>The other reasons why I installed a water softener are:  </p>
<ul>
<li>I intend to install solar water heating, and I don't want its heat exchanger to be impaired by limescale.</li>
<li>Less time cleaning the bathroom, and no money to spend on anti-limescale cleaners.</li>
<li>The washing machine and other appliances should last longer. In my previous house the loo stopped working because of limescale building up!  </li>
</ul>
<p>The model I had installed is a Kinetico 2020c. This softener doesn't use any electricity, it uses water pressure to refresh the ion exchange chamber with brine, so the only consumable is salt.  </p>
<p>Regular readers (hey don't snigger, there's at least one <em>actually</em>) will
remember I
<a href="/scale-of-problem.html">talked about getting a magnetic water softener</a> ages ago. I decided against that because although I think they can work in some situations, I wanted something that would definitely work for me.</p>
