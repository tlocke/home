    <p>Mandelson has <a href="http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/banking_and_finance/article7086282.ece">criticized the large amount of money</a> that the president of Barclays earns. But Barclays wasn't bailed out by the government, so I don't think it's the government's role to involve itself in how businesses choose to pay their employees.  </p>
<p>What I'm angry about is Mandelson's government <a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/finance/tracycorrigan/9595207/Budget_2009_the_true_cost_of_the_UKs_bank_bailout_/">spending Â£140 bn of our money</a> on subsidizing some banks. No business should get a bailout from the government. I'm concerned that certain banks were so politically well connected that they could lobby the government into giving them so much of our money. All three main parties would have done the same thing, so I don't know who to vote for in the forthcoming general election.</p>
