    <p>My friend Zoe moved house recently, and was offering people books that otherwise would be thrown out. One of the books I took was 'The Watcher' by Jane Palmer. I think I'm probably missing the point somewhat, but it read like a children's book. Not that that's a bad thing, but was it Palmer's intention?  </p>
<p>It kept my attention engaged, and there were some genuinely humorous moments. At one point the android is reprimanded by its creator:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>'You did nothing You are totally useless. You will dismantle yourself and cease functioning. You cannot even be trusted to collect elementary information about the planet.'  </p>
<p>'I can walk under water. [...] And I've got a good job in the police force.'<br>
One of the things I didn't like was the idea of people having spirits. It reminded me of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/magazine/04evolution.t.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5088&amp;en=a43cfb7b24423cc6&amp;ex=1330664400&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss">agent detection theory of God and spirits</a> that I first read about in Stephen Pinker's 'How the Mind Works'.</p>
