    <p>I'm lying in bed with a temperature. All day I've heard about the latest <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israel-presses-on-with-gaza-attacks-1216843.html">Israeli onslaught against the Palastinians</a>, and it makes me angry.  </p>
<p>Israel should end its occupation of Palastine, and withdraw to within its own borders. Israel should withdraw regardless of what the Palastinians are doing. The Israeli argument is that they are defending themselves against Hamas rocket attacks. But to the Palastinians it looks like Israel is the agressor.  </p>
<p>If Israel withdraws, and the rocket attacks still persist, then a UN force should be deployed in Palastine to surpress the rocket attacks. I doubt if the rocket attacks would continue, because there's only public support for Hamas because they are perceived as resisting the Israeli occupation.</p>
