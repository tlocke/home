<p>Kazim lent me this book after our jaunt in the Malverns. His copy has a US flag with swastikas as the stars. He hoped it would get me funny looks on my train journey home (it didn't).  </p>
<p>There are several books that I've had to stop reading due to psychological disquiet, one of them was a Philip K Dick. High Castle had that quality, though to a lesser degree. It's clever, engaging and mildly disturbing. It was a bit too enigmatic for my taste, I like to have everything laid out clearly. I'm not brainy enough to grasp the full meaning of the book. Interestingly, in this book there's a discussion about what an author is trying to say in a book. All very post-modern I'm sure.</p>
