    <p>Moving on to the next box. Here was the stuff I had to deal with:  </p>
<p><img alt="Deep Storage 1" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120701_143510.jpg"></p>
<p>I called it Deep Storage. It is all a bit embarrassing. Those black plastic rings used to be on the end of the cylindrical spotlights that used to be in my bedroom at Deverell Close. I removed them because they seemed to serve no purpose.  </p>
<p>In the bottom right hand corner is my address book. I think it had about eight people in.  </p>
<p><img alt="Deep Storage 2" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120701_144047.jpg"></p>
<p>I used to play for the Bath Gladiators junior American football team. We used to train every Sunday. I think we only ever played one proper match. I can remember that match. It was a really hot day at the Bath rugby ground. A burger stand was set up. I was a wide receiver. I only had the ball thrown to me once, but I did catch it. Awesome!  </p>
<p>The middle document is the list of skiing exercises that we had to do before going on the school trip to Aprica when I was nine.  </p>
<p>I think the writing on the right was my mum teaching me French before my GCSE exam. I didn't really know much French until then, but she taught me for two or three hours, and I learnt more in that time than in several years of school lessons.  </p>
<p><img alt="Deep Storage 3" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120701_145001.jpg"></p>
<p>At school we had to write about a hobby or activity that we did in our spare time. I wrote about the Under 17s Car Club.  </p>
<p><img alt="Deep Storage 4" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120701_145135.jpg"></p>
<p><img alt="Deep Storage 5" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120701_145204.jpg"></p>
<p>I think it was in the summer holidays between the 4th and 5th years at Dauntsey's that I did work experience at an architect's office, the Carter Hughes Partnership. I dressed smartly in a jacket and tie, and made cups of tea, picked up photos from the developers, ran off copies of architectural drawings from the ammonia copier machine.  </p>
<p>On the right is the draft of a letter to send to a bank. It was humorously modified by my brother. It's worth zooming in to read it.  </p>
<p><img alt="Deep Storage 6" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120701_145435.jpg"></p>
<p><img alt="Deep Storage 7" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120701_145719.jpg"></p>
<p><img alt="Deep Storage 8" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120701_150109.jpg"></p>
<p>The bottom right booklet is a programme for the Elixir Of Love, an Opera in which I had a non-singing part. I played a soldier. We rehearsed at Bath Uni.  </p>
<p><img alt="Deep Storage 9" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120701_150701.jpg"></p>
<p>A leaflet from Lost In The Mix. The sort of thing that doesn't happen any more, now that the internet is here.  </p>
<p><img alt="Deep Storage 10" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120701_151418.jpg"></p>
<p>I seemed to be always lending money to my parents...  </p>
<p><img alt="Deep Storage 11" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120701_151438.jpg"></p>
<p>Draft of an article for the school magazine.  </p>

<p>There's a photo of Roger, our dog. And there's me.  </p>
<p><img alt="Deep Storage 17" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120701_153001.jpg"></p>

<p><img alt="Deep Storage 19" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120701_153533.jpg"></p>
<p>In the sixth form I interviewed the head teacher Mr Wetz. Here's how it appeared in the school magazine.  </p>
<p><img alt="Deep Storage 20" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120701_153933.jpg"></p>

<p><img alt="Deep Storage 26" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120701_154604.jpg"></p>
<p>A photo of me with a massively bouffant hair style, looking a bit like Kim Jong-Il.  </p>
<p><img alt="Deep Storage 27" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120701_155133.jpg"></p>
<p>More drafts for the comedy page of the sixth form magazine.  </p>
<p><img alt="Deep Storage 28" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120701_155259.jpg"></p>
<p><img alt="Deep Storage 29" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120701_155342.jpg"></p>
<p>A to-do list from my work experience at Carter Hughes:  </p>
<p><img alt="Deep Storage 30" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120701_155444.jpg"></p>
<p>Phil's coaches was the minibus that took us to school in the sixth form. On the right is a list of cakes. It was one of my duties at Carter Hughes to buy cakes.<br>
<img alt="Deep Storage 31" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120701_155610.jpg"></p>
<p><img alt="Deep Storage 32" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120701_155802.jpg"></p>
<p>Dave's writing...worth zooming in!  </p>
<p><img alt="Deep Storage 33" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120701_155829.jpg"></p>
<p>I went with my dad to London to see the Career Analysts. A big event. In the break for lunch I met up with my dad and we had a meal at a restaurant. I remember having trout and the waiter came over with an enormous pepper mill. Delicious meal. The analyst asked me what I wanted from the job, and I said that I wanted to be content. She asked me if I had ever been content!  </p>
<p><img alt="Deep Storage 34" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120701_155900.jpg"></p>
<p>It must have been in the third or fourth year that my brother and I both got stereos. Doug went for one with detachable speakers and better sound quality. I went for one that had a double take deck so that you could copy and dub music etc.<br>
<img alt="Deep Storage 35" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120701_155948.jpg"></p>
<p>In the sixth form I bought a Barbour jacket.  </p>
