    <p>Some time ago I started reading a Wendy Perriam. 'The 50 minute hour ' I think it was called. I found I just couldn't get into it. Perriam was an author I remember my mum reading, so I thought I'd give her another go with Lying. I believe that Perriam has the reputation of producing aga sagas. Joanna Trollope is the queen of the aga saga. Didn't she bridle at that label, saying her work could be bleak and challenging?  </p>
<p>Well, I'm divagating. One of the characters, James Egerton, explains that Saint Augustine thought that evil wasn't a thing in itself, but rather an absence of good.  </p>
<p>I watched <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capote_%28film%29">Capote</a> yesterday, and the message seemed to be that Capote was wrong to manipulate the trial in order to suit his own writing. Of course this was wrong, but it's the kind of wrong that still gives me hope. I think the worst thing is nihilism, where nothing matters. Capote is better than that because he thought that something mattered (his book) but he just got the wrong thing.</p>
