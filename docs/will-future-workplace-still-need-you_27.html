    <p>My friend Kazim Ladimeji has written a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Will-Future-Workplace-Still-Need-ebook/dp/B0106CUM7C/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1443373773&amp;sr=1-1">Will The Future Workplace Still Need You?</a>, which I've just finished reading. As he says, this isn't a book of philosophical speculation, but a practical guide on what action the individual should take to avoid being replaced by a robot. The time-scale goes from the present to about 20 years in the future.  </p>
<p>One of the things that impressed me about this book was that it's based on a number of rigorous studies, and concrete examples are given that are properly referenced. In short, it's well researched.  </p>
<p>Kazim tells us about jobs that have already been automated, and then those that will be automated in the near future. He also talks about jobs that have a low probability of being automated, and new jobs that don't exist yet. These new jobs include Nostalgist, Rewilder and Robot Counsellor. When I saw the title Robot Counsellor I thought it meant people that talked to robots that had problems. To find out what it actually means, you'll have to read the book!</p>
