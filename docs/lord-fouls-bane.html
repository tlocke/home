    <p>Possibly the last time I read a book in the fantasy genre was at school in the 4th and 5th year when I'd go to the library to escape the rough bullying types, and congregate with the weedy misfits. David Eddings was one author I remember. From what I see in libraries he's still popular (do they take books off library shelves if they're not popular?).  </p>
<p>I've always avoided fantasy subsequently. Gnomes and wizards just seem silly. I've never got on with Terry Pratchett or Harry Potter books.  </p>
<p>It was by mistake that I picked up The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant: Unbeliever by Stephen Donaldson at Bath Central Library a few weeks ago. I thought it was sci-fi, but then saw it was fantasy. Ahhh!  </p>
<p>On the cover it said it was a classic from the 70s and for some reason that appealed to me. I know you shouldn't go by covers, but I do. The Chronicles is a trilogy, and I've finished the first book, Lord Foul's Bane. It was great! I like the central character, a reluctant hero. An anti-hero I suppose. The Donaldson dude uses a lot of unusual words; can I have the book in electronic form so that I can click on a word and see its definition please?</p>
