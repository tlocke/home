    <p>'The God Delusion', is an enjoyable polemic against faith in god. I agree with Richard Dawkins that the best scientific explanations of the world are superior to god-based supernatural explanations. I begin to diverge from Dawkins when he makes the claim that being an atheist makes you a better person than if you have faith in God. Just because you're right, doesn't make you a better person!  </p>
<p>I would go as far as saying that being an atheist doesn't necessarily make you any worse than anyone else, but it doesn't necessarily make you any better either.  </p>
<p>Jehova's witnesses occassionally call at my door. I'm pleased that they do, and we have a conversation about what we believe about the world. I explain that I take religious texts in two parts, physics and morality. The physics part of all religions I've heard of is rubbish. Souls, spirits, virgin births, God etc. are really bad explanations compared to quantum mechanics, evolution etc. The morality part of religions is a mixed bag. I think 'do as you would be done by' is a pretty good idea. A lot of the other stuff is a bit grim though.</p>
