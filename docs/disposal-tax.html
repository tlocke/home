    <p>Regardless of how much or how little rubbish I throw away, I have to pay the district council a flat rate. This means there's no incentive to reduce packaging, and so there's no incentive to reduce the council's bill for disposal.  </p>
<p>I've heard some say, 'Yes, we need to charge people according to how much they throw away'. This is crazy talk because:  </p>
<ul>
<li>People will just dump their rubbish in laybys.</li>
<li>It's not just a question of volume of rubbish, it's what's in there; and people don't have the time or expertise to differentiate levels of disposability.</li>
</ul>
<p>My solution is to have a disposal tax on every product that will ultimately be thrown away. There would be a number of categories depending on how costly particular materials are to dispose of. For example a paper bag would be in a cheaper category than a plastic bag.</p>
<p>The tax would cover the entire rubbish collection budget, and so that element could be taken out of the council budget.</p>
<p>I've added this idea to the <a href="http://www.tlocke.org.uk/page/0">Political Manifesto</a>.</p>
