We went to see this at the Little Theatre yesterday. It was a good film for a number of reasons:  </p>
<ul>
<li>It had the tension and excitement of a thriller.</li>
<li>The aesthetic of grubby hi-tech was well done.</li>
<li>The technology was believable.</li>
<li>Its characters were interesting.</li>
<li>The dialogue was well written.  </li>
</ul>

<p>There were flaws though. I had a sense that the plot was a shade unrealistic, or worse, fell short on integrity. For example, it wasn't clear exactly what was happening with the communications to Earth. It's probably that I didn't understand it properly!  </p>
<p>As ever with this type of story, the robot is the most interesting character. I think this is because it forces the viewer to think about what it means to be human.</p>
