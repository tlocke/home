    <p>Initially the dialogue was clever, but it became relentlessly clever, and I said wearily, okay Martin, you win, you've more than proved yourself, now leave me in peace.  </p>
<p>It was okay because I found an antidote in the search for an explanation for prime numbers.  </p>
<p>I went back to the Widow now and again, and I started to enjoy it more and more. There were tensions developing, and some of the clever things made sense, and I still laugh at the bit of the telegram that read, 'black bear repeat black bear'.  </p>
<p>I very much like the end of the book where there are chapters for various years after main story, explaining what happened to the characters. More authors should do this.</p>
