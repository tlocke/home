    <p>The train company wasn't greedy enough. They could have made quite a bit of money if they'd have added another couple of carriages.  </p>
<p>The problem is that there's no competition. If there had been, then a more commercially aware company would have taken their customers.  </p>
<p>It's difficult to see how you can have competition in the railways. Nationalization doesn't help, that means a monopoly with absolutely no competition whatsoever!</p>
