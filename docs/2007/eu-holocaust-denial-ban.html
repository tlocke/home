    <p>I heard on the radio that someone's come up with the idea of <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6263103.stm">making it illegal to deny the holocaust in Europe</a>.<br>
I think that the holocaust did happen. Why do I think that? I'd like to be able to say that I've done a thorough review of the historical evidence. I haven't, because I don't have the time, money or skill. In fact, it's such a huge undertaking that no single person can fully investigate it on her own. The reason I believe it is true is that I'm relying on peer reviewed research where knowledge is built up by open argument and evidence gathering.  </p>
<p>If there were a law that forbade the expression of a particular opinion, this process of open discussion couldn't work. Therefore, this proposed law would cause doubt about the facts of the holocaust.  </p>
<p>Future posts coming up on these two questions...  </p>
<ol>
<li>How should we treat holocaust deniers, racist political parties etc?  </li>
<li>What, if any, are the limits of free speech?</li>
</ol>
