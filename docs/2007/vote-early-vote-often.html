    <p>Dear reader, today is election day in Trowbridge. I voted before work, and there was a trickle of people at the polling station. Both West Wilts District Council and Trowbridge Town Council are up for election. I'm ashamed to say that I'm ignorant of the candidates, and local party policies. In fact I know more about the French presidential election (I'd vote Sarkozy).  </p>
<p>I read through the various leaflets that landed in the hall, and I ended up voting for the party that had the fewest grammatical errors in their campaign literature (Liberal Democrats).  </p>
<p>In order to make a really well informed choice I think one would have to follow local politics week in, week out. I'm just not that interested. I think the thing I care about most locally is the architecture.</p>
