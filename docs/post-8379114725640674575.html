    <p>Thanks for your comment Miguel!  </p>
<p>You say that a carbon tax isn't going to happen soon enough. Why? Implementing a CO2 tax is much easier and therefore quicker than with a FIT. The points where fossil fuels enter the country are few, which makes taxation easy, and there is no administrative burden on the renewable generators. In contrast, with FITs the administrative burden in demonstrating renewableness is huge, and falls entirely on the renewable generators. We've seen this problem with ROCs which are terribly onerous.  </p>
<p>You also say that FIT subsidizes THE solution. It's wrong to say that the only solution is renewables. The other option is to simply not use the electricity in the first place. Under FITs the higher cost of brown electricity goes to subsidizing renewables, under <a href="http://www.tlocke.org.uk/page/1">CO2 Taxback</a> the money goes back to the people to spend as they wish. People would be more able to afford to insulate their houses for example.  </p>
<p>Lastly, FITs don't address the other sources of greenhouse gases, whereas a carbon tax does. Presumably you'd have other schemes to deal with these. The problem with this approach is that you end up with a cost for transport emissions that is different from the cost of emissions from power stations, which leads the consumer to make irrational choices.</p>
