    <p>I like post-apocalyptic fiction, so Zoe recommended Justin Cronin's The Passage. Charlotte had borrowed it, so she gave it to me. It's a fairly long book, but very readable. Somewhat of a distance was put between the book and me by the colloquial, American, 'soccer mom' style. Also, hints of the supernatural put me off. For example, it's never explained how the virals communicate. Cronin's left things open for a sequel, and perhaps these things will be explained. I'm certainly intrigued to find out what happens next. I like the bigger picture that's intimated by the excerpts from Sarah's diary which was presented to an academic conference far in the future. I do want to see that bigger picture so lend me the next book Zoe and Charlotte!</p>
