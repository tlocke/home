    <p>The publisher of <a href="http://taft2012.com/">Taft 2012</a> sent me a free review copy. It's the first time that's happened to me. They must have seen other book reviews here on my blog.  </p>
<p><a href="http://taft2012.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/taft2012-196x300.jpg"><img alt="Taft" src="http://taft2012.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/taft2012-196x300.jpg"></a></p>
<p>I've been boasting to my friends about this literary honour, but now the time has come to actually write the review I'm conscious that I'm no <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._R._Leavis">F. R. Leavis</a>.  </p>
<p>If a book can have a personality, it strikes me that the book has the same personality as its protagonist, genial and balanced. I wouldn't describe it as a feel-good book, but my mind turned to it when I was in need of some light, enjoyable intelligent sanity.  </p>
<p>President Taft existed in our history, but Heller describes a parallel universe where Taft returns a century after his disappearance. The story then unfolds without any more preternatural events. At a time when US politics seems highly polarized, Taft has a broad appeal that taps into core American values. The book is written by an American, for Americans, but is very accessible to a British audience.  </p>
<p>The publishers have linked the book to a website, which I confess I haven't examined in detail. I like the linear book format (either on paper or screen), and dislike non-linear, interactive experiences. I'm sure that's a shortcoming in me rather than anything else.  </p>
<p>Would I have become a Tafty? Perhaps!</p>
