    <p>I've been overtaken by a wave of nostalgia after listening to the Mock Turtles' Can You Dig It? The picture in my mind is me in my first year at uni, on my skateboard going down the hill on the pavement outside Plas Gwynn. I was probably on my way to the shop. I haven't kept up with the people I knew at Uni. What happened to Kamala, Chris, Steve and Karen?</p>
<p>Once I was skating with Dan. We took it in turns to go down the sloping curve of the drive of the halls of residence. I came off and hit my head and was unconscious for a few seconds. Dan thought I was just messing around, but I really was unconscious. We went back to someone's room. I sat on the floor with my back to the wall, recovering.</p>
