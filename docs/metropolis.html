<p>This has been on my 'list of films to see' for ages, and by heaven it was worth seeing!  </p>
<p>This film is prescient about so much:  </p>
<ul>
<li>The Human-Machine burning at the stake, revealing a metalic body is pure Terminator.</li>
<li>Fredersen demonstrates Skype.</li>
<li>The first use of the Human-Machine is as an 'erotic dancer', setting the pattern we've seen ever since of porn and hi-tech advancing together, intertwined, into the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a silent film, with text giving a narrative. I like this, films should revert to written descriptions of what's going on. It would help me to understand what was going on.  </p>
<p>The film is divided up into sections like an opera. We start off with a prelude, then there's an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermezzo#Opera_intermezzo">intermezzo</a>. I like that too. After the prelude I paused the DVD and fetched chocolate / coffee bean <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag%C3%A9e#Chocolate">drag√©es</a> to eat during the intermezzo. I recommend you do too.  </p>
<p>The main idea of the film is that 'the heart must be the mediator between the head and the hands' in the body politic. I take this to mean that capitalism creates wealth most quickly, but it's not distributed fairly. A compromise is to have capitalism, but tax income to fund a citizen's allowance so that everyone can benefit from the wealth that capitalism creates. If it does mean this, then I heartily agree!</p>
