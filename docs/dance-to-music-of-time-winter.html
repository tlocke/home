    <p>Blimp was surprised that I hadn't read 'A Dance to the Music of Time' so I thought I'd give it a go. The language is sophisticated, and I think I missed a lot of cultural references. Powell sometimes constructs sentences in an odd, contracted manner. The collection I read was the last three books in the series, collectively called 'Winter'. It would probably have been better to start at the beginning, but I was impatient and this was all that the <a href="http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/BathNES/leisureandculture/Libraries/information/batharea.htm#bath">library</a> had.  </p>
<p>The characters are drawn in a subtle and engaging way. This type of story reminded me of War and Peace, although DMT doesn't have a historical agenda as W&amp;P does. It's entertaining to be drawn into the intrigue and interplay of the characters. The reader is immersed in the flavour of the period and I found myself at times taking on the style of speech in the book. It made me sound pompous and daft.  </p>
<p>I reckon I'll be looking out for the other books in the series...</p>
