    <h1>Shaftesbury Mews</h1>
    

    <p>The idea of this page is to keep a track of the land that the owners of 1, 2, 3, 4 and
5 Shaftesbury Mews, Bath have joint rights over (common land). Here's a map showing the
driveway in yellow and the bin store and bike store that we have equal use of and rights
over:</p>

</p>

<p>Recently a parking space was created to the right (towards Shaftesbury Road) of the bike
store as shown below:</p>

</p>

<p>The owners of the Shaftesbury Mews houses give their permission for any other owner to
use the parking space. Also, the owners give permission for any other owner to park in
the yellow area, as long as it's not causing an obstruction.</p>
<h2>Public Right Of Way</h2>
<p>The path that goes from Beckhampton Road to Third Avenue (along the bottom of
Shaftesbury Mews) is a public footpath. Apart from that there are no other public
rights of way, either on foot or by vehicle. Here's an excerpt from an email from the
council on the topic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From: Jenny Nobbs &lt;Jenny_Nobbs@BATHNES.GOV.UK&gt;<br>
Date: 25 May 2023 11:24</p>
<p>I have researched the area including this path.  The only section of path I have
included in a legal order is the section marked A-B on the attached plan. This
section will be recorded as a public footpath at the end of the confirmation period
(after 29th June 2023).</p>

  </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I made the decision not to include the section of path between Shaftesbury Road and
the path marked A-B (on the attached plan) in my recommendation to be recorded as a
public right of way. I have discovered no new evidence to support the existence of a
public right of way running along this section of path. </p>
<p>In answer to your question about public rights, it would be very unlikely that the
public would ever have acquired a public right to drive a car down the path as they
would have to be using it as a through route, from one highway to another. </p>
<p>It is possible that a public right of way exists on foot along the path but I have
not discovered any information to support this. </p>
