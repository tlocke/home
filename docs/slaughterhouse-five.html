    <p>When Kurt Vonnegut in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughterhouse-Five">Slaughterhouse-Five</a> writes that for the Tralfamadorians:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>All moments, past, present and future always have existed, always will exist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He's anticipating the ideas of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Barbour">Julian Barbour</a>, who argues that time doesn't exist. That view seems to be part of Max Tegmark's <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0709.4024">Mathematical Universe</a>. The idea of the mathematical universe appeals to me, as it embraces the ideas of Barbour and also the idea of a multiverse, explained brilliantly in The Fabric Of Reality.  </p>

Anyway, back to the book. People who know about these things would say that it's post-modern. It refers to itself, the author appears, all sorts of things. Tristram Shandy I thought.  </p>
<p>I must say that I can't stand stories that play these clever tricks. Vonnegut gets away with it this time because it's so brilliantly done, and because the subject suits it. Usually though, you can't beat a proper story. Just like Iain Banks writes.  </p>
<p>Having said that, I find it liberating that one can write successfully in a variety of ways. Nietzsche wrote a book entirely of aphorisms. I hope that the important thing is having something to say, and the form can look after itself.</p>
