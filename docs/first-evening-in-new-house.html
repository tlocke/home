    <p>This the first evening that I moved in. Helen and Toby were staying with me for a couple of days. We watched an episode of House and had some Bailey's. It was really cold, and I hadn't worked out the heating properly, so we were bundled up in blankets and duvets. I've just noticed that their photo of me is much better than my photo of them!  </p>

<p>Helen and Toby stayed at my house in Trowbridge from 2nd Jan after they came back from travelling. They cooked all the evening meals. Here's a photo of some chopping. My chopping board had rarely looked so properly used.  </p>
