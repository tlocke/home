<h3>Gallum</h3>
When I was born we lived on a narrow boat. I can't remember anything from this time.<br>
<br>
<h3>Ensley Gardens</h3>
Or 'Ensley Gargens' as we said as kids, and my parents picked up. I can remember walking in from the back garden, crossing the threshold of the door, with the radio on (I think it was the Archers, but definitely Radio 4). As I remember it, the back door led into the kitchen which was painted a vivid blue.<br>
<br>
At about this time I remember jumping up and down on a bed with my brother, my Granny Helen in the room. I think there was Noddy wallpaper on the wall.<br>
<br>
<h3>Bearfield Buildings</h3>
I can remember sitting up in bed on my own thinking, 'Wow, I'm four years old today'. I sort of mentally took a photo looking down on myself.<br>
