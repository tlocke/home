    <p>Whenever I read John Wyndham, I'm struck by how prescient his thoughts are. Here he is talking about what we'd now call <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_technology">disruptive technologies</a>:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The discoverer and inventor are the bane of business. A little sand in the works is comparatively a mere nothing - you just replace the damaged parts, and go on. But the appearance of a new process, a new substance, when you are all organized and tickling nicely, is the very devil. Sometimes it is worse than that - it just cannot be allowed to occur. Too much is at stake. If you can't use legal methods, you must try others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is from The Day Of The Triffids, which I'm reading at the moment. There are lots of other comments and asides throughout his books that are astonishingly far-sighted.</p>
