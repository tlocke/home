&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/sep/01/biography.society"&gt;The Death Of Sigmund Freud (Fascism, Psychoanalysis and the Rise of
Fundamentalism)&lt;/a&gt;. If ever I
mention Freud, people say, "Freud? Hasn't he been shown to be wrong?". Over the
years I've read this and that by Freud or about him and he was a great
wellspring of intelligent, original ideas. He was fearless in his thinking,
and didn't recoil from publishing ideas that were shocking to society. The
reader does have to pick out the ones that are actually true though. I say that
I've read about Freud, but as Edmundson says about Hitler, 'he read a great
deal, but it's not at all clear that he understood much of what he read'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, here is my view of the three most important things I think Freud
was right about: the unconscious mind, the cause of neurosis, the cure for neurosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking those in turn, the unconscious was central to Freud's ideas, and is now
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconscious_mind#Contemporary_cognitive_psychology"&gt;well established by modern science&lt;/a&gt;. In a nutshell, the unconscious mind works away beneath one's awareness, but
can determine much of one's behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freud thought that neurosis was caused by a breakdown in communication between
the conscious and unconscious mind. Certain events, ideas, feelings etc are
'repressed', that is they are trapped in the unconscious, and the conscious mind
lacks access to them. Being cut off from parts of oneself was held by Freud to
be the cause of neurosis. Is it true that this is the cause of neurosis? I
think the scientific evidence leaves this question open. For myself, I am
persuaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final idea of Freud is that communication between the conscious and unconscious can be restored, and repressed thoughts, feelings etc. can be processed and become accessible again to the conscious mind. The route to doing this is the
'talking cure'. A therapist can provide a space for non-judgemental listening,
where the client tries to be as uninhibited as possible about what they are
saying and gradually hitherto unconscious material rises to the surface.
Dreams are also thought to be a way in which the unconscious mind communicates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So does the talking cure work? Again, this is controversial. I'm inclined to
think it is beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>France 2019</title><link href="/france-2019.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-07-13T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-07-13T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2019-07-13:/france-2019.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Staying in a medieval town, there is plenty of inspiration for sketches:&lt;/p&gt;

Google Analytics account and found 7 tracking codes that I've set up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first one is the code for OwnId, which was a website that made it easy
  to use a custom host name as your OpenId. OpenId never really took off,
  email addresses are easier as an ID than host names. The code is in an
  &lt;a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/openid-delegator/"&gt;SVN repository on Google
  Code&lt;/a&gt;, and I've removed
  the tracking id from Google Analytics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've got Google Analytics tracking ID set up for my old blog. In the blog
  settings it's not activated though. I've deleted the tracking id from
  Google Analytics now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.mtrhub.com/"&gt;MtrHub&lt;/a&gt; is a website I made for keeping track of
  utility meter readings. Looking at the code and the website I don't think it
  currently uses Google Analytics. I've deleted teh tracking id form Google
  Analytics now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's also a tracking id for the http://www.own-id.com/. That's closed now
  so I've deleted the tracking id.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.polifesto.com/"&gt;Polifesto&lt;/a&gt; is a website for anyone to write a
  political manifesto. It doesn't look like it uses Google Analytics at the
  moment. I've deleted its tracking id.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My old website which http://www.tlocke.org.uk used to point to, apparently
  had a tracking id. The site on Google Pages in GSUite. I've turned off
  Google Pages for &lt;code&gt;tlocke.org.uk&lt;/code&gt;. I've deleted its tracking id.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, my &lt;a href="http://maths.tlocke.org.uk"&gt;maths website&lt;/a&gt;, doesn't use
  Google Analytics any more, so I've deleted its tracking id.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was a lot easier than I thought it would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now I've deleted my Google Analytics account!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Non-tracking blog</title><link href="/non-tracking-blog.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-05-06T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-05-06T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2018-05-06:/non-tracking-blog.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My website and blog were hosted by Google, which tracks people on an industrial

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;http://gigask.foo/organizations/3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;http://gigask.foo/organizations/3/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But most users would think the two were equivalent. What's to be done? I think the RFC should have said that the first should be normalized …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Trailing slashes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://www.gbiv.com/protocols/uri/rfc/rfc3986.html"&gt;RFC 3986&lt;/a&gt; the following two URLs are not necessarily equivalent:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;http://gigask.foo/organizations/3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;http://gigask.foo/organizations/3/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But most users would think the two were equivalent. What's to be done? I think the RFC should have said that the first should be normalized to the second. However, working with the RFC as it is, we can issue a 301 (Moved Permanently) from http://gigask.foo/organizations/3 to http://gigask.foo/organizations/3/. Purists might object that a 301 is for a resource that used to exist but has moved, and http://gigask.foo/organizations/3 never did exist. I'm a purist but I don't think this use of 301 stretches its meaning too far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cool URIs don't change&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say we have to refer to organizations, we might have URLs like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;http://gigask.foo/organizations/sweb/&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;http://gigask.foo/organizations/centrica/&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;http://gigask.foo/organizations/eon/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the approach favoured in http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/library/us-cranky8.html. If Sweb undergoes a rebranding and the new name is EDF can make http://gigask.foo/organizations/sweb send a permanet redirect to: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;http://gigask.foo/organizations/edf/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some problems with this approach are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the URLs are maintained manually, it takes time / money for a diligent webmaster to remember to add the redirect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the URLs are for a web application, the web application software becomes more complicated, again costing time / money. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if another company starts up with the name SWEB? (Unlikely with this example, but you can imagine it being a problem in other contexts).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These problems are solved with a scheme like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;http://gigask.foo/organizations/974563/&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;http://gigask.foo/organizations/67/&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;http://gigask.foo/organizations/879881/&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This takes &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI"&gt;Cool URIs don't change&lt;/a&gt; to an extreme. The drawback is of course that URLs lose much of their meaning, but my view is that the tradeoff is worth it. Okay, so you've convinced my to use meaningless ids. What about using ISBN codes for books and license numbers for cars as my id?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Established ids in URLs?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book 'Being And Nothingness' by Jean-Paul Sartre has ISBN 0671867806. If on my website I have reviews of books, should I use the ISBN?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;http://gigask.foo/book-reviews/0671867806/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, because I may have got the isbn wrong, and then the URI would have to change. Better to have a completely new id:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;http://gigask.foo/book-reviews/2859783/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if I have the ISBN and I want to find the corresponding review on gigask.com? It should be possible to do a query like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;http://gigask.foo/book-reviews/?isbn=0671867806&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the URL equivalent to the &lt;a href="http://www.bcarter.com/intsurr1.htm"&gt;intelligent versus surrogate keys&lt;/a&gt; debate in SQL.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Customer service is expensive.

So it was with Girl With A Pearl Earring.

Same with the pewter wine decanters.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theoretical physics was my favourite subject. Dr Mathai took us for that, and I got on with him well.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I can't believe what I understood at that time. There'd be no way I could do a first year physics exam now. I could probably do GCSE though. I can't believe that any human could possibly understand all those pages of equations. I was just an average student, so it's astonishing what humans can do. It should give us all a bit of confidence in ourselves.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a book can have a personality, it strikes me that the book has the same personality as its protagonist, genial and balanced. I wouldn't describe it as a feel-good book, but my mind turned to it when I was in need of some light, enjoyable intelligent sanity.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Taft existed in our history, but Heller describes a parallel universe where Taft returns a century after his disappearance. The story then unfolds without any more preternatural events. At a time when US politics seems highly polarized, Taft has a broad appeal that taps into core American values. The book is written by an American, for Americans, but is very accessible to a British audience.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The publishers have linked the book to a website, which I confess I haven't examined in detail. I like the linear book format (either on paper or screen), and dislike non-linear, interactive experiences. I'm sure that's a shortcoming in me rather than anything else.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back over the folder of work, I'm impressed that anyone (let alone me) could understand all the gobbledegook, and yet at one time I did understand things like solving Schroedinger's wave equation for a potential well.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could never understand anything through lectures, I always preferred reading books. The lectures told you what was on the syllabus though. In the second year my friend Chris was a year ahead of me, and he gave me his notes on the second year and I didn't go to any lectures. I did well that year, better than the final year when I had to go to lectures!  &lt;/p&gt;

They were terrible, and just couldn't do it, so I moved to BT, who were excellent. Bill recently asked how much BT costs. I'm with the 10 GB per month option. I've gone over that a few times, and they charge you an extra £5. Anyway, here's what BT have taken out of my account:  &lt;/p&gt;

I stepped onto the road so that we could pass, and he thanked me.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wondered if he had applied Kant's test that if everybody rode bikes to work, would things work out okay? If so, I think he would have passed Kant's test, because there would be no cars on the road, and cycling would be fine and wouldn't interfere with pedestrians. However, a motorist applying Kant's test would also say that if everyone that rode a bike drove a car instead, then pedestrians would be able to walk along the pavement because cars (should) never go on the pavement.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought that there must be a better way to illustrate this flaw in Kant's thinking. Forget about bikes, how about this:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm driving on the left hand side of the road. If everyone drove on the left hand side of the road, all would be well, so according to Kant I'll carry on. Someone else is driving along on the right hand side of the road, and she reasons that if everyone else drove on the right hand side of the rode, all would be well. We crash, and thus refute that the Kantian approach works in all cases.  &lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Archiving Box November 1989</title><link href="/archiving-box-november-1989.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-07-08T14:04:00+01:00</published><updated>2012-07-08T14:04:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2012-07-08:/archiving-box-november-1989.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Moving on to the next box.

&lt;p&gt;I called it Deep Storage. It is all a bit embarrassing. Those black plastic rings used to be on the end of the cylindrical spotlights that used to be in my bedroom at Deverell Close. I removed them because they seemed to serve no purpose.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the bottom right hand corner is my address book. I think it had about eight people in.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to play for the Bath Gladiators junior American football team. We used to train every Sunday. I think we only ever played one proper match. I can remember that match. It was a really hot day at the Bath rugby ground. A burger stand was set up. I was a wide receiver. I only had the ball thrown to me once, but I did catch it. Awesome!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The middle document is the list of skiing exercises that we had to do before going on the school trip to Aprica when I was nine.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the writing on the right was my mum teaching me French before my GCSE exam. I didn't really know much French until then, but she taught me for two or three hours, and I learnt more in that time than in several years of school lessons.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At school we had to write about a hobby or activity that we did in our spare time. I wrote about the Under 17s Car Club.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it was in the summer holidays between the 4th and 5th years at Dauntsey's that I did work experience at an architect's office, the Carter Hughes Partnership. I dressed smartly in a jacket and tie, and made cups of tea, picked up photos from the developers, ran off copies of architectural drawings from the ammonia copier machine.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the right is the draft of a letter to send to a bank. It was humorously modified by my brother. It's worth zooming in to read it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom right booklet is a programme for the Elixir Of Love, an Opera in which I had a non-singing part. I played a soldier. We rehearsed at Bath Uni.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Deep Storage 9" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120701_150701.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went with my dad to London to see the Career Analysts. A big event. In the break for lunch I met up with my dad and we had a meal at a restaurant. I remember having trout and the waiter came over with an enormous pepper mill. Delicious meal. The analyst asked me what I wanted from the job, and I said that I wanted to be content. She asked me if I had ever been content!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the time has come to say goodbye to Yahoo! Groups Labs Applications (beta) and Groups Chat. We thank all the users that were a part of this program. We intend to use this learning to enhance Yahoo! Groups further with new features.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 04, 2012, we will shut down the Yahoo! Groups Labs  Applications (beta) and Groups Chat. We request you to backup any data that you might have created using the applications.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This closure will not affect your other services on Yahoo! Groups.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a real problem with Yahoo!'s attitude to user content. Content created by a user should never be deleted, and Yahoo! doesn't understand that. It's fine to shut down a service, but the content should remain in perpetuity, not be erased. It's valuable to the user, and until Yahoo! understand that, they won't be trusted by me.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Skip</title><link href="/skip.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-06-27T22:45:00+01:00</published><updated>2012-06-27T22:45:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2012-06-27:/skip.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There's a skip permanently placed near my house.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Sweat" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120623_152251.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The page on the right is from a book of fonts that I found really useful. I'd copy out the letters, often tracing them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Fonts" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120623_152521.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this drawing was by my brother. He was always drawing cars.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Car" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120623_152748.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawings of people in the sixth form common room I think.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Sixth Form" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120623_152815.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing of a bridge in Oxford, probably done while I was in the sixth form. Oddly enough I was in Oxford yesterday sitting on a bench and I looked up and saw that very bridge.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Bridge" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120623_152835.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our dog Roger, immortalized.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Roger" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120623_152910.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Random architectural type drawing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Architectural" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120623_152940.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sketch from Oxford again. My Mum's publisher was in Oxford, and we went down there occasionally. I remember drawing this when waiting for her to come out of a meeting.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Steps" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120623_153004.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A riverside building in Bradford On Avon that has now been turned into retirement flats. These architectural type drawings were done when I was trying to build up a portfolio to do architecture at Uni.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Flats" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120623_153030.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classical sketch.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Temple" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120623_153126.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charcoal drawing of a plant.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Plant" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120623_153153.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treehouse?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Treehouse" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120623_153238.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure where this house is.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="House" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120623_153353.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Tree" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120623_153444.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is of a house by the canal in BoA.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Canalside House 1" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120623_153506.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Riverside Building" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120623_153953.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This building by the canal in BoA is still there. Been done up now. I should do a before-and-after.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Canalside Building" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120623_154047.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Collection" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120623_155832.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="1977" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120623_164529.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...1977.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it was in primary school that we did a project on native Americans. I remember calling myself Green Feather. Here's a pouch I made. I also recall going to the American museum in Bath.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Bag" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120623_164653.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never saw Ghostbusters, but the logo fascinated me.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a big barbecue at Alexandra road. Lots of people from Open World and lots of my friends came. We lit flares in the garden. I chopped down a lot of foliage in preparation. Emma was very angry that I'd cut down a particular plant. Saying, 'that plant was the only reason I moved into this house!', and 'are you going to concrete over the garden next?'.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This squash racquet is a lot older. At Dauntsey's there were squash courts. I enjoyed playing and wasn't that good, but could hold my own. I distinctly remember playing against someone and Dappo (one of the alpha-male types) came up and offered his support and encouragement and advice on a feud I was having with someone. I can't remember the guy's name. Let's call him Guy. I'd had a fight with Guy after a hockey game. I'd got a nose bleed and so the result of the fight looked much worse than it actually was. It was perhaps the next day when I was playing squash that Dappo heard about the fight and came to find me. I think he thought that an injustice had occurred and it was his job as unofficial leader to help the weaker members of the group (me). I politely declined his help.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is when I did some work for Alan Beadnell. We had plans for a lot more work. I can remember planning one of the first online estate agents. Pity that never got off the ground. I did do a kind of JavaScript fruit machine gadget.  &lt;/p&gt;

It's a fairly long book, but very readable. Somewhat of a distance was put between the book and me by the colloquial, American, 'soccer mom' style. Also, hints of the supernatural put me off. For example, it's never explained how the virals communicate. Cronin's left things open for a sequel, and perhaps these things will be explained. I'm certainly intrigued to find out what happens next. I like the bigger picture that's intimated by the excerpts from Sarah's diary which was presented to an academic conference far in the future.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to see more pedestrianization of Bath. In particular the route for pedestrians from Oldfield Park to the city centre should be improved with more zebra crossings and paths. Going further, I think that private cars should be barred from the city centre to make it more pedestrian / cyclist friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

I think it was on Tuesday 23rd April that the contents of my garage in Trowbridge was moved to Bath by Me &amp;amp; My Van. The tenants had moved in the previous day, and so the removal of the contents of the garage was somewhat overdue. This is the stack of stuff that I have to deal with. It's completely blocking access to the downstairs loo. It's right against a radiator, so I can't have the heating on.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Junk 1" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120427_222612.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I seem to remember that it was in the 4th year at Dauntsey's that I made this contraption. The design brief was to make a self powered vehicle that would drive to the edge of a table top, and then stop before it went over the edge. This was my effort; the wheeled probe dropped off the edge of the table and blocked the driving wheels. I remember that I put rubber bands around the driving wheels to get more traction for starting and mainly for stopping.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Junk 2" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120427_223126.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better view of the stopping mechanism. At school we were in an old building while a brand new CDT facility was being built.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Vehicle" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120427_223150.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this was made in the 3rd year, at St. Laurence School. It was designed for a competition between schools. The crocodile / dragon monster was propelled by rubber bands, and the jaws went up and down in a chomping motion as it went along. There were smoke bombs in the nostrils. Unfortunately the teacher messed up the times and when we arrived my category of the competition was over!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Monster" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120427_223655.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Called 'List Of Possible Albums'. From time at Dauntsey's. Perhaps a list of albums to buy? I think more likely a choice of album to do an alternative cover for.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drawing of a plant. I'd read that Charles Rennie Mackintosh did a lot of drawings of plants and that fed through into his work, so I copied that idea.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lamp was part of my CDT GCSE exam. It used a halogen bulb, which had a temporary plastic cover. Unfortunately I left the temporary cover on, and the teacher didn't notice to take it off when the examiner came to look at it, so the examiner didn't get to see the lamp working properly.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Sleeping Bag" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120406_205527.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've had this sleeping bag for ages. Since I was a child. Certainly since the early 80s, maybe even before! It's been with us on family holidays, packed in the Renault 4. Used as a barricade on the back seat to prevent my brother and me fighting. Great value sleeping bag!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Jumper" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120409_121620.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lovely old jumper. I remember I used to wear it in the sixth form a lot circa. 1989. I remember going to the Ancient Fowl and drinking Zambuca with my friends. Probably Gareth Adams and Jo Carrier IIRC. Some of the holes in the jumper were no doubt made by Roger (our dog).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Blanket" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120409_124643.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the sixth form I suffered from depression, but one thing I did manage to do was redecorate my room. I had a futon with this African blanket on it, over the duvet. The blanket was probably given to us by my aunt. I think the spare use of colour is perfect. From photos, I sort of thought it might be the kind of thing that Lyall Watson might have.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Jumper" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120409_124950.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never wore this jumper much. I think it went in the wash at too high a temperature and shrank. Anyway, I remember wearing it at Uni. I said to my friend that I was worried about an upcoming exam. She said there was no way I could fail, wearing that jumper!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Clothes" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120419_204707.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doug brought the back this Tour de France 1998 t-shirt back from France for me. I've worn it a lot!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Club" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120419_210407.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another t-shirt brought back for me by Doug on his travels. This one is from a nightclub in Prague where he saw Sigourney Weaver.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Free Tibet" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120419_210758.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doug went to see the Dalai Lama and brought back this t-shirt. Even though it's not written in English, you can tell the date is 1991, because it's a palindrome. Next to it is a towel of great family historical significance. Although the exact significance I can't remember. Perhaps it was my grandmother's?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Act 1" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120419_211208.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, all the dates of the University Drama Club. I was in a couple of plays. I've gone on about that elsewhere enough I'm sure. The white t-shirt is from the Uni Environmental Society. I wrote the constitution and demonstrated outside Sainsbury's. Also remember fly-posting furtively, but didn't really realize it was illegal.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Green Group" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120419_211244.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Jumper" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120419_211748.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Uni a friend of mine was shocked that this jumper had so many holes in. I replied that it was the height of fashion and that the holes had been made at great expense by a designer wearing black. She actually partially believed me! Years later I was wearing it at the Mason's Arms on Newtown in Bradford On Avon. Bill remarked that it really wasn't a jumper to wear outside the house. I've more or less followed his advice since.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Skateboard" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120421_162007.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was walking along at Uni and some guy said, 'are you into skating?' because of the clothes I was wearing. I said no, but said I was interested in being interested. So we went and bought a skateboard and did some skating! I've given the skateboard away now.

&lt;p&gt;This is a good definition, but a shortcoming is the alternative to RF:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'alternatively, patents may be covered by a non-discriminatory promise of non-assertion'  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm suspicious of this alternative to RF and do not see the necessity for it. Retaining it would add complexity and confusion where none need exist.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm pleased that the definition excludes FRAND. FRAND is incompatible with Open Source software and it would be disastrous if an open standard couldn't be implemented by Open Source software.&lt;/p&gt;

One of his housemates was there and talked about Charles Dickens. I opined that Dickens was sentimental, melodramatic and at times lurid. She recommended Anthony Trollope. I remembered that but never got round to it. So when I was in the process of moving to Bath, I promised myself that I'd read Trollope when I finally moved in. Amazingly someone gave me Trollope's He Knew He Was Right, just at the time I was moving in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a brilliantly told story, or really set of stories, as it's done in soap opera style. The main thread is about a man getting himself into a terrible mental state, over a period of many months. His psychological decline then leads to his physical decline. One of Trollope's achievements is to portray the step by step decline convincingly. The book is leavened with social sub-plots with engagements made and broken, swings between poverty and wealth, and the stubborn eccentricities of Miss Stanbury. Post boxes were introduced in Britain by the author, and Miss Stanbury took against them, complaining of the iron stumps, and saying that any decent person would walk to the post office. It reminded me of the attitude to wind turbines today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Childhood Books" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120318_173404.jpg"&gt;
  Some books from my childhood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearing out the garage, I had to confront this stack of books from my childhood. There are so many memories attached to these books. It's moving to look through them, evoking sadness and nostalgia.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Books 1" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120318_175550.jpg"&gt;
  More books&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those top 3 are a boxed set of Michael Crichton books that my brother gave me for Christmas (or birthday, can't remember which). I liked them, thanks for the present! I can see a book by William Poundstone there. Interesting person. I read about him much later when he was promoting his latest book on electoral reform in the US. A proponent of range voting if I remember correctly.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Books 2" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120331_171556.jpg"&gt;
  Lots of memories here&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That top one is supernature by Lyall Watson. I've
&lt;a href="/lyall-watson.html"&gt;written about him before&lt;/a&gt;. A classic book. Then The Meaning Of Liff, by Douglas Adams and John Lloyd. I remember having it in my pocket as a teenager, and taking it out and reading it when we were visiting Ikea in London by bus. My mum thought it said, Meaning Of Life and thought it was a religious / self-help book. She said, 'that won't help you'. I didn't say anything. The book takes place names, and uses them for things that we don't have a name for. One that I remember is Polbathic, meaning to have the ability to turn bath taps on and off with your feet. Does God Play Dice? was very influential for me. I think I went to visit Dundee University and bought this book for my brother. Of course he wasn't at all interested and I was really just buying it for myself, but I fooled myself into thinking I was buying it for him. You know what I mean. This book first got me into fractals and chaos, which was one of the things that made me switch from Architecture to Physics at Uni. It was one of the few things I felt I understood, and created fractals from modelling diffusion limited aggregation for a project. During the Uni holiday I ran the simulation overnight on a laptop that my dad borrowed from work. The next book is H.G.Wells' The History Of Mr Polly. I read it at Uni, and it has a wonderfully peaceful ending. I was in much need of peace of mind when I read it. Polly Devlin's All Of Us There was actually given to me by Polly Devlin herself! Her husband was involved in a company called Open World that I worked for. I was asked to go over to their house and fix her computer. I did my best with it, and I hope I left it in a better state than I found it. In return she gave me a copy of her book. Lastly, the dictionary. On the front it boasts, 'Updated for the 90s'.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Cravat" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120331_221510.jpg"&gt;
  Cravat&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the cravat I wore when I played the older Bernard in Dennis Potter's Cream In My Coffee. We took it to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival where it was seen by lots more than one person!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="OS Maps" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120331_221643.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You youngsters don't know how lucky you are. We used to have to have these Ordance Survey maps in the days before smartphones and OpenStreetmap. Actually, some people loved the paper maps, my dad for one. He had a collection of them on a couple of bookshelves. They were a feature of my childhood. It annoyed me that there were duplicates for some. Why not throw away the older one? One sure way to torture my dad was to fold a map incorrectly.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Throwing stuff out from the garage</title><link href="/throwing-stuff-out-from-garage.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-03-15T21:26:00+00:00</published><updated>2012-03-15T21:26:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2012-03-15:/throwing-stuff-out-from-garage.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a stack of books before being taken to the charity shop round the corner.

&lt;p&gt;I've had this old fishing box since I was about 9 (or maybe 12!). My interest in fishing fizzled out, and I used it as a tool box. I've got a new tool box now, and I don't need two.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Fishing Box" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120303_161143.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An assortment of things. Swimming trunks that are too small. Shorts that are too short. My brother's skiing hat that he must have worn the second time I went skiing. Was I 10? I was nine the first time I went. The sort of bandanna type things that I used to have to wear when I had really long hair if I didn't want it getting in my eyes.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Clothing" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120304_135218.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've just started to clear out the garage of the house in Trowbridge. Here are two old toys from my childhood. I can't remember which year I was in at St Laurence school when we had to make a model of the Saxon church. We were provided with a cardboard net, but I used Linka to make plaster tiles which I stuck together. I didn't come first, but did well enough to be awarded a Mars bar.&lt;br&gt;
Books like The Mad Motorists were a fixture on the bookshelves in our house. I never read them, but the spine's are very familiar. It's so sad to throw them out, but if I didn't throw things out I'd be living in a heap of junk.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi, please find attached my Direct Debit form for my Council Tax.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed that the form was in the MS-Word format. Unfortunately this is a proprietary format that requires software from Microsoft to handle it properly. I don't have the Microsoft software but I managed to decipher it! I've also sent my reply in the Microsoft format (although I may not have been able to mimic their doc format accurately), and I've also sent my reply in the Open Document Format. This is an open format, and so can be read with a variety of word processors, such as LibreOffice or OpenOffice.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can I make the suggestion that BANES publish their documents in an open format so that users have a choice of word processors to use, and aren't tied to a single supplier (Microsoft)?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Btw, I'm publishing this email on my blog, and hope to publish your reply, so let me know if that's not okay.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks,  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;27 January 2012 Dear Mr Locke, Thank you for your email of 10 December 2011 to General Enquiries at the DfT about your journeys from Trowbridge to Bath Spa on First Great Western trains. First; I apologies for the length of time it has taken to reply to you. I am also _sorry to hear about your unpleasant travel experience. In your letter you highlighted your concerns about overcrowding on FGW trains when you travel in them from Trowbridge to Bath Spa. I recognise that this does not address your specific complaint, however, you may never the less be interested to hear that the Government has looked afresh at earlier plans to increase rail capacity by acquiring new trains. The Government has a programme under which additional rolling stock to address over crowding is funded. This programme has led to new rolling stock being ordered, and allowed other rolling stock to be made available to train operators elsewhere. The Department has recently concluded HLOS deals with FGW which will provide additional rolling stock to strengthen the busiest local regional services including the Bristol area. Correspondence from the public does form an important part of our understanding of how rail franchises are performing and I am therefore grateful that you have taken the time to bring your concerns to our attention. Yours sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;

It seems to advocate removing subsidies for renewable energy. I agree, but at the same time the subsidies for all types of energy should be removed too. The report says:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it seems very reasonable to expect that scrapping the Emissions Trading Scheme and allowing other sources such as nuclear energy to fulfil the Renewables Obligation could cut electricity bills by 10 per cent or more&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But says nothing about the subsidy that is given to nuclear power by making the taxpayer responsible for paying the &lt;a href="http://blog.tlocke.org.uk/2011/03/insuring-nuclear-power-station.html"&gt;cost of any nuclear incident above £140m&lt;/a&gt;. The recent Fukushima incident will &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/20/us-japan-nuclear-noda-idUSTRE79J3W020111020"&gt;cost Japanese taxpayers at least \$13bn&lt;/a&gt;. Does the Taxpayers' Alliance think the tax payer should continue to subsidise nuclear power in this way?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another energy subsidy that's ignored in the report is the taxpayer's subsidy of electricity generated from coal. A &lt;a href="http://solar.gwu.edu/index_files/Resources_files/epstein_full%20cost%20of%20coal.pdf"&gt;recent paper&lt;/a&gt; shows that:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accounting for the many external costs over the life-cycle for coal derived electricity conservatively doubles to triples the price of coal per kWh of electricity generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These external costs are ultimately borne by the taxpayer. One of the external costs is the damage to human health caused by mercury emissions from coal fired power stations. Quoting from the same paper:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct costs of mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants causing mental retardation and lost productivity in the form of IQ detriments were estimated by Trasande et al.22,23 to be \$361.2 million and \$1.625 billion, respectively, or 0.02¢/kWh and 0.1¢/kWh, respectively. Low-end estimates for these values are \$43.7 million and \$125 million, or 0.003¢/kWh and 0.007¢/kWh; high-end estimates&lt;br&gt;
for these values are \$3.3 billion and \$8.1 billion, or 0.19¢/kWh and 0.48¢/kWh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the taxpayer has to bear these costs. Why doesn't the Taxpayers' Alliance speak out against this subsidy of coal?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll send this post to the Taxpayers Alliance, and I'll let you know their reply.  &lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Film Licensing For The Internet Age</title><link href="/film-licensing-for-internet-age.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-12-30T22:22:00+00:00</published><updated>2011-12-30T22:22:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2011-12-30:/film-licensing-for-internet-age.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Sintel-screenshot-2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Sintel" height="136" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Sintel-screenshot-2.jpg" width="320"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Perhaps it should be moved to bigger premises? Anyway, this isn't an objective summary of the talk, it's infused with my own strongly held views!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two things stood out in the talk. Rhodes explained that not all oil is the same. Light oil has low viscosity, and heavy oil has high viscosity (bitumen being the heaviest). On another axis, sweet oil is low in sulphur, and sour oil has high sulphur content. Rhodes reckons we've used about half of the total oil in the earth, but most of the stuff we've used is light and sweet, and most of the oil left is sour and heavy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is that light and sweet oil is easy to extract and use. Heavy and sour oil is hard to extract and refine. In the worst case (bitumen) it takes 3 barrels to extract 4 barrels.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing that I hadn't properly realized was that wind turbines need rare earth elements (REE) in their manufacture. Rhodes says that China has 97% of the REE in the world, and they need all of that for their own turbines. He opined that scarcity of REE would be the thing stopping the expansion of wind turbines. &lt;a href="http://www.pwc.com/gx/en/sustainability/research-insights/metal-minerals-scarcity.jhtml"&gt;Is that true?&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Cream Tea</title><link href="/cream-tea.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-12-17T14:12:00+00:00</published><updated>2011-12-17T14:12:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2011-12-17:/cream-tea.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Cream Tea" src="/images/2011/IMG_20111009_151521.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Whereas I think that our future is that we'll become less human. Our brains haven't changed dramatically for thousands of years. That's going to change, and change rapidly.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sci-fi books, people tend to have bodies and brains and move around. Why do people move? A person's brain doesn't leave its skull (unless something horrible has happened). People move around so that their sensors can gather certain information, in other words, to experience things. If those sensations can be transmitted, then there's no need to move.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people will want to augment their evolved capabilities. At the moment such people use laptops and mobile phones and enormous data centres run by Google etc. A future person may choose to extend their intelligence and emotional intelligence by perhaps inhabiting several data centres around the world. This takes up a lot of resources, space and energy. This mode of life would only be available to the rich. Who would become rich? Why, those who have extended their intelligence and emotional intelligence of course!  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="book-review"></category></entry><entry><title>Wikimedia Image Filter Referendum</title><link href="/wikimedia-image-filter-referendum.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-08-25T22:31:00+01:00</published><updated>2011-08-25T22:31:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2011-08-25:/wikimedia-image-filter-referendum.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Now and again I make an edit to Wikipedia and Wiktionary, which makes me eligible to vote in the &lt;a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image_filter_referendum/en"&gt;Image Filter Referendum&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi, could you send me a hardcopy statement
with my name, address and international bank
account number please? The internation bank
account number (IBAN) is needed, and so I think
you might have to print it out manually as it
doesn&amp;#39;t come out on your automatic statements.

Thanks for your help,

Hello Tony

I can provide you with a statement but there
is a charge of £2.50. Would you still like
a statement?

If it is just the IBAN you require please find

The idea is that the Chinese write most of the software in the world, including surveillance cameras for prisons. They include code that sends a copy of what's recorded back to a TV station that broadcasts it. Nobody knows for sure who's behind it (except of course the Chinese). To bring it back to my &lt;em&gt;idée fixe&lt;/em&gt;, this highlights the security risk of proprietary, as opposed to Open Source, software.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Macleod's books are enjoyable, but are too complicated for me to follow. I could probably understand them if I maintained a diagram of the characters, plot and time-scale, but that would be ridiculous. In a few years, when our minds have been uploaded to computers that are orders of magnitude superior to our brains, I'll re-read his books, just to see what it's like to totally understand everything.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a certain 'alternate history' dimension to the book. Historical events that occurred in our time-line happened differently in the book. This is a subtlety that not so much pulls the rug from under your feet, but is like walking on a rug that has been put on a very shiny floor. It's also a brilliant way for the writer to never get her facts wrong. For example, Macleod calls &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burkhard_Heim"&gt;Burkhard Heim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Gerhard&lt;/em&gt; Heim. Is that a genuine mistake, or is it a subtle deviation from our history?&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Fuel Poverty</title><link href="/fuel-poverty.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-07-18T22:15:00+01:00</published><updated>2011-07-18T22:15:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2011-07-18:/fuel-poverty.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've noticed the phrase 'fuel poverty' being used.

It also implies that someone could be in poverty in every way apart from fuel, which is equally absurd.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't misunderstand me, I agree that poverty is a problem, just don't call it 'fuel poverty'.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying this just to be picky. Calling it 'fuel poverty' implies that fuel is too expensive and must somehow be made cheaper. Calling it poverty however, allows us other options, such as keeping fuel's high price but at the same time to stop taxing poor people.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Trusteer Rapport: Proprietary</title><link href="/trusteer-rapport-proprietary.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-07-18T21:44:00+01:00</published><updated>2011-07-18T21:44:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2011-07-18:/trusteer-rapport-proprietary.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just sent this to my bank, &lt;a href="http://www.smile.co.uk/"&gt;Smile&lt;/a&gt;:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jamie was the first person on stage, and he looked very different to normal. I know that's what actors are supposed to do, but when it's someone you know it's a bit weird. The play was built around a recording studio, with two rooms separated (in the audience's imagination) by glass. The audience could hear from both rooms, but the characters could only hear the other room when the intercom was on. Got that?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set-up must have been very technically demanding on the actors, as the dialogue had to be synchronized with the characters in the other room. They pulled it off though, and the whole thing worked well. I don't usually laugh out loud very much, but I did that evening. Jamie's character, a street urchin addicted to his mobile phone, popped up throughout the play, and was a favourite with the audience.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Of Plugs And Cables</title><link href="/of-plugs-and-cables.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-06-26T17:33:00+01:00</published><updated>2011-06-26T17:33:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2011-06-26:/of-plugs-and-cables.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I was given a Kindle, I was delighted that the cable connecting the Kindle to the plug could be unplugged and used to connect the Kindle to the computer!

&lt;p&gt;It's really an incremental upgrade, bigger screen, better battery life, faster. The OS is the same, so the things I used to do on the old phone are done the same way in the new one. The hardware though has additional features such as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_field_communication"&gt;NFC&lt;/a&gt;, which I've yet to get my head around.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In choosing the phone, I wanted it to be as open as possible, so I wanted to avoid the proprietary UI add-ons such as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Sense"&gt;Sense&lt;/a&gt; which HTC uses. Also I wanted the phone to be designed for people to have &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooting_%28Android_OS%29"&gt;root access&lt;/a&gt; to it, without having to jailbreak it. The Nexus S fits the bill.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>A Seagull Walking On Water</title><link href="/seagull-walking-on-water.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-06-20T22:38:00+01:00</published><updated>2011-06-20T22:38:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2011-06-20:/seagull-walking-on-water.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Seagull 1" src="/images/2010/2010-12-11_13_39_23.jpg"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am writing to you as part of the consultation on the Draft Defamation Bill. I welcome the direction of the bill, but feel it doesn't go far enough to allow full freedom of speech. I would like to see the whole idea of defamation taken out of the legal system. My view is that any possible good that can come of censorship is greatly outweighed by its harm. I am afraid that any defamation law will be abused by the rich and powerful to suppress criticism and dissent. Thus, I believe that anybody should be able to state any view, whether or not some think it false or malicious.&lt;/p&gt;

The last 1/4 is speculation on the future of cosmology, trying to answer the 'why are we here?' question. That too is incredibly gripping reading. Davies leans towards teleology. Teleology in physics? That was new to me, but interesting.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One idea is that we're living in a simulation, a fake universe Davies calls it. From reading The Fabric Of Reality, I've became convinced that even virtual reality can tell us a lot (maybe everything) about reality. So it was with a jolt that I read:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the universe is a sham, why bother to find out how it works?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd answer that even an illusion is real, it's just not what we think it is. A virtual reality simulation of a car isn't a real car, but it is modeled in a computer, which is real. So each part of the simulation maps onto a part of the computer, so you get a mapping between virtual reality and reality. If you can work out this mapping, you can understand reality!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Red Tape Challenge</title><link href="/red-tape-challenge.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-05-21T20:24:00+01:00</published><updated>2011-05-21T20:24:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2011-05-21:/red-tape-challenge.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've taken the government's &lt;a href="http://www.redtapechallenge.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/environment/industrial-emissions-and-carbon-reductions/"&gt;Red Tape Challenge on industrial emissions&lt;/a&gt; and carbon reduction.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I accept that the world needs to curb its greenhouse gas emissions. The problem is that the UK has saddled itself with a huge bureaucratic burden in trying to deal with the issue, and all these regulations aren’t working properly. I advocate the abolition of all the GHG schemes, including EU-ETS, ROCs, LECs, CRC, CCL, REGOS, FiTs and CHPQA, to be replaced with a carbon tax. The revenue raised from the carbon tax should be divided up equally amongst the population, and returned to people through the income tax system. In this way it would be a revenue neutral tax for the government.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A carbon tax is easy to collect, because there aren’t many points that fossil fuels enter the country, eg. ships and pipelines. This is in contrast to the current schemes that involve large numbers of people both in government and industry working on endless form filling.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the criticisms of a carbon tax is that it causes fuel poverty. If the revenue is divided up equally amongst the population and returned through the income tax system, fuel poverty would be avoided.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question arises as to the level that the carbon tax should be set at. I suggest that parliament sets an emissions target, and then every month the carbon tax rate is adjusted by an independent committee to ensure we hit the target. It would work a bit like the Monetary Policy Committee sets interest rates to meet an inflation target.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For nine months, Manning has been confined to his cell for twenty-three hours a day. During his one remaining hour, he can walk in circles in another room, with no other prisoners present. He is not allowed to doze off or relax during the day, but must answer the question “Are you OK?” verbally and in the affirmative every five minutes. At night, he is awakened to be asked again “Are you OK?” every time he turns his back to the cell door or covers his head with a blanket so that the guards cannot see his face. During the past week he was forced to sleep naked and stand naked for inspection in front of his cell, and for the indefinite future must remove his clothes and wear a “smock” under claims of risk to himself that he disputes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RE: Online council tax billing and booklets  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently Wiltshire Council does not have the facility for paperless billing. This is something that we are looking to develop in time.&lt;br&gt;
With regard to the accompanying booklet, an electronic version is available online by following the link below.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that the problem is the cap on the liability of nuclear power companies if there's an accident. That is, if an accident occurs and its clean-up cost exceeds the cap (&lt;a href="http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/news/pn11_007/pn11_007.aspx"&gt;[£140m]{.il} in UK&lt;/a&gt;) then the government has to pay the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this cap were to be removed, then the financial incentive to reduce insurance costs would drive safety improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the position of the government is that nuclear power shouldn't be subsidized. But is not the cap on liability a subsidy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm pleased that the government is talking about &lt;a href="http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/news/pn11_007/pn11_007.aspx"&gt;raising that cap to €1.2bn&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Hi, here's my personal response to the Electricity Market Reform consultation. Can I remark that I'm pleased that it's published under the excellent &lt;a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/"&gt;Open Government License&lt;/a&gt;. There are answers to the specific questions later on, but first I wrote some notes on the Executive Summary.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• even as we improve energy efficiency, demand for electricity may need to&lt;br&gt;
double by 2050 –&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This 'predict and provide' policy isn't optimal for electricity generation. It's the job of the government to make sure there's a competitive market for electricity, but it shouldn't have any kWh targets. The natural balance of supply and demand provides the optimal solution.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• as decarbonisation of the economy means that electricity provides more of our heating and transport needs;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True, the economy does need to decarbonise, but the government shouldn't impose the solution of using more low-carbon electricity. It can only increase the cost of emitting CO2 by taxing fossil fuel at source, and then Organizations and individuals will respond to those price signals. Some will save electricity, some will buy green electricity, some will use more electricity but less petrol or various other combinations, depending on what's optimal for them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• to ensure security of supply, we will need to replace a quarter of our existing capacity by 2020, which are ageing and unlikely to meet environmental regulations. In the current system, maintaining the level of security of supply is left to market forces;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most secure method *is* market forces. That's what I rely on to make sure there's a loaf of bread for me at the supermarket.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• the power sector needs to lead the decarbonisation of our economy,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government should not be making this assertion.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but the current market has a bias towards fossil fuels. DECC’s 2050 analysis shows that the power sector emissions need to be largely decarbonised during the 2030s.The Committee on Climate Change has recently proposed that the power sector should be close to zero-carbon by 2030;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De-carbonisation of the electricity supply is just one of the solutions. Others include insulating homes properly, or using less electricity. The government shouldn't dictate any particular solution.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• around 30% of our electricity in 2020 needs to come from renewable sources (largely onshore and offshore wind), up from 7% today, to meet our legally binding EU target for renewable energy. The Government has asked the Committee on Climate Change to provide further advice in Spring 2011 about the longer-term potential for renewable energy;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proportion of renewables isn't the important thing. The important thing is how much CO2 we're emitting per capita.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Under the current market, gas-fired generation is currently the lowest cost and lowest risk investment. It will continue to play an important role in the electricity sector – providing vital flexibility to support an increasing amount of low-carbon generation and to maintain security of supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think the government should be saying what will and what will not play a role in the electricity sector.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, current arrangements need to be reformed to allow equal access to the electricity market for a wider range of technologies, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other technologies already have equal access to the market. In fact many of the technologies receive subsidies, which should be removed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm pleased that the report accepts the importance of improving the technical functioning of the market eg. sharpening the buyout price and reducing barriers to competition. I don't thing it's right that these vertically integrated large energy companies can own DNOs, suppliers and generators.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm dubious about the levelized cost for nuclear power. Does it include the full cost of insurance?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are my responses to the specific questions. I haven't answered every question, since earlier questions already give the answer.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current Market Arrangements&lt;br&gt;
1. Do you agree with the Government’s assessment of the ability of the current market to support the investment in low-carbon generation needed to meet environmental targets?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. With a carbon tax in place of the FiTs, ROCs, LECs, EU-ETS, CRC and REGOs the current market is able to properly play its part in reducing pollution.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Do you agree with the Government’s assessment of the future risks to the UK’s security of electricity supplies?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. The current market is capable of delivering security of supply. The graph of capacity margin that shows EEUs escalating in the future is unrealistic. As the margin gets tighter, prices increase, which lessens demand and restores the margin.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Do you agree with the Government’s assessment of the pros and cons of each of the models of feed-in tariff (FIT)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I disagree with FiTs because they support renewable generation rather than penalizing CO2 emissions. CO2 emission are the problem, not necessarily lack of renewable generation. Since I disagree with FiTs I haven't commented on the remaining FiT questions.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12. Do you agree with the Government’s assessment of the impact of an emission performance standard on the decarbonisation of the electricity sector and on security of supply risk?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I disagree with the EPS. There shouldn't be separate arrangement for certain generators. A fossil fuel tax based on CO2 emissions when burnt would cover all circumstances.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19. Do you agree with our assessment of the pros and cons of introducing a capacity mechanism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadly, but I think you have underplayed the cons.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20. Do you agree with the Government’s preferred policy of introducing a capacity mechanism in addition to the improvements to the current market?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. A capacity mechanism would needlessly increase electricity prices, and would increase bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Shortlisted!</title><link href="/shortlisted.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-02-26T16:15:00+00:00</published><updated>2011-02-26T16:15:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2011-02-26:/shortlisted.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm psyched to have received this email about

If U2 doesn't hold the secret of happiness, who does?&lt;br&gt;
Voltaire, that's who. But more on that later. First, our eponymous hero asks (Martin I think):  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Do you believe," said Candide, "that men have always massacred each other as they do today, that they have always been liars, cheats, traitors, ingrates, brigands, idiots, thieves, scoundrels, gluttons, drunkards, misers, envious, ambitions, bloody-minded, calumniators, debauchees, fanatics, hypocrites, and fools?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd answer that yes, people have always done those things, but I'd argue that basically humans do whatever they can to improve their lot. In a well designed system, the cost of being a thief for example is too high and so instead it's in a thief's interest to abandon her life of crime and keep to the straight and narrow. What is a well designed system? Well, democracy helps, and an open and transparent and independent judicial system. Also, I think the aim of government should be to maximize individual freedom.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Philosophers tend to be better at asking questions than providing answers, so Voltaire surprised me at the end of the book. After the adventures of Candide and his companions had ended, they ended up at a bit of a loose end. They got bored, and rather directionless. Then a happy neighbour, a farmer, gave Candide the idea of having a garden for he and his friends to work on. Happiness ensued!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="book-review"></category></entry><entry><title>Please Fine First Great Western For Their Poor Service</title><link href="/please-fine-first-great-western-for.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-02-13T15:33:00+00:00</published><updated>2011-02-13T15:33:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2011-02-13:/please-fine-first-great-western-for.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was enraged enough to fire off an email to the Department For Transport yesterday:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning the First Great Western train from Trowbridge to Bath Spa was scheduled to stop at Trowbridge at 10:14. It didn't stop because it was too full to pick up any more passengers, so everyone had to wait for the 10:44.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point is that this is entirely predictable because this train is *always* packed. First Great Western has been given a monopoly by the regulator, and so in the absence of competition, the regulator has a duty to step in and punish poor service. So please would you act on behalf of the passengers and fine First Great Western?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cycling past Bath Abbey, Rufus looked up, and suddenly the stone changed from an ancient grey to a brand new yellow. His bike collided with a crowd of medieval peasants gathered where the taxi rank once was. Everything was different. Do you fear abruptly jumping back in time?  &lt;/p&gt;

A lot of the books I read were on physics, and almost none on architecture, so I realized that physics was where my true interest lay. I've not regretted my decision.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buildings do have a big effect on me. I'm disappointed in architecture. I believe that the main function of a building is to inspire. It's terrible that the buildings I like best are medieval, and things have got steadily worse since then, reaching their nadir in the 60s and 70s. Things have improved a bit since then, but we're still bad at such an important thing. Why is that?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One theory, and one that I would have tried to put into architectural practice (pun ahoy) is that above a certain scale, beautiful things have to be fractal. Loosely speaking, if you look at a good building it looks similar at different scales. The eye can't comprehend the whole thing in one go.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Rhodos1493.png/220px-Rhodos1493.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Rhodes" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Rhodos1493.png/220px-Rhodos1493.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I remember reading in a book on fractals somebody asking why the branches of a tree in front of the moon has an aesthetic quality, but a rectangular office block against the moon doesn't give the same effect.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's the point about scale. Generally, new cars are progressing in design quality as time goes on, they look good. People talk of their 'clean lines'. The same with Apple hardware. Buildings have got worse though. I think that small things can get away with not having a fractal quality, but large things can't.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The downloading of the tiles is really slow. I've turned off the tile buffer, where it downloads tiles off the edge of the screen, but it's still slow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To get the current position, it doesn't trigger the retrieval of GPS coordinates. An app does, but a browser app doesn't.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm writing this at Willow cottage in Lostwithiel. I traveled by train, the return from Trowbridge costing just under £60. It's a littoral line for part of the way; here's a photo out of the carriage window:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An advantage of the Kindle is that I don't have to take bulky, heavy books around. I'm not sure how many books the Kindle will hold, but there are 4 stored at the moment, and I'm sure there's room for thousands. I charged it up on Christmas Day, and haven't had to recharge since, and that's having read 2.5 books on it so far.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the train to Cornwall I finished The Picture Of Dorian Gray. The first two books I read on the Kindle both had the word Gray (or Grey) in the title. &lt;a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/50067/Is-proof-if-proof-be-need-be-a-Chris-Morris-coinage-or-a-real-phrase"&gt;Proof, if proof be need be&lt;/a&gt;, that God exists. I won't write much about TPODG because I've got a headache at the moment, but it's a salutary book that transmits the protagonist's desperate feelings to the reader.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="book-review"></category></entry><entry><title>To Kill A Mockingbird</title><link href="/to-kill-mocking-bird.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-01-09T12:29:00+00:00</published><updated>2011-01-09T12:29:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2011-01-09:/to-kill-mocking-bird.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The one plot flaw is that Atticus or Aunt Alexandra would have gone to the pageant.

&lt;p&gt;The book was lent to me ages ago by Clive at work. For some reason it sat unread on a table in my dining room, on top of Matt's collection of Clint Eastwood western DVDs. I've received increasingly strong hints from Clive about returning the book, so I read it on Friday / Saturday. Just gotta remember to put it in my bag, and then hand it to him.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the book. At the end they were wrong to cover up what actually happened with Ewell. There should have been a proper investigation. What do you think?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a very buttoned-up book. Agnes is a bit of a goody goody. Puerile as I am, my idea is to re-write Agnes Grey with frequent references to bodily functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, she is also very honest, which makes it such an engaging read. There are few books where the author conveys so clearly their own thoughts, feelings and actions. While reading it, one really feels one knows what it's like to be Agnes Grey. I think it's safe to say she's an introvert, happy when reading or walking alone, but social life is still very important to her, and life without her friends is unthinkable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really should be grateful that I live in an age where social interaction is so easy.

&lt;p&gt;I first want to talk about the plug. Duncan tells me that the iPhone plug works like this as well, but the Kindle is the first place I've seen it. The adapter is built into the plug, and the plug has a USB port. That means you can use the same lead for connecting the plug to the Kindle, as you use for connecting the Kindle to the computer. I think that's just brilliant thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kindle directs one to buy a proprietary book from their website. I'm a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Culture_movement"&gt;Free Culture&lt;/a&gt; zealot, so instead I searched for Agnes Grey on &lt;a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page"&gt;Project Gutenberg&lt;/a&gt; and downloaded to to my laptop. Then using the aforementioned cable copied into the 'documents' folder on the Kindle. Reading is a fantastic experience. The outstanding feature of the Kindle is the screen. It just doesn't look like a screen. It looks like printing on plastic. If we ever get any sunlight, I'll let you know how it performs under those conditions!

&lt;p&gt;And some of you may ask: 'Is there any value to privacy?'&lt;br&gt;
All new ideas are dependent on some kind of mental privacy - the potential for peace and reflection. The Vast Machine provides information about us and gives the authorities a wide variety of ways to manipulate our thoughts with a subtle power. Everything we hear and see can be shaped to create certain prejudices. Free will - that is, our ability to make real choices about significant issues - becomes an illusion. Gradually, we are surrounded by targeted messages that destroy the opportunity to make our own decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Powerful stuff. A strong argument against my view that privacy can be abandoned. My response is that 'peace and reflection' requires preventing write access, not read access to one's brain. It's true that the more people know about us, the easier it is to manipulate us. But it's at manipulation itself that we should draw the line, not the &lt;em&gt;ability&lt;/em&gt; to manipulate.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="book-review"></category></entry><entry><title>Grandet, A Warning To Misers</title><link href="/grandet-warning-to-misers.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-11-29T21:16:00+00:00</published><updated>2010-11-29T21:16:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-11-29:/grandet-warning-to-misers.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In Country House, Blur sing:  &lt;/p&gt;

For the faint at heart, a new start&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eugenie Grandet is my first Balzac and I very much enjoyed it. He has fairly
long descriptions, but they aren't tedious! EG is set in the Loire Valley,
where Balzac was born / brought up I believe. I
&lt;a href="/gite-la-licorne-1.html"&gt;spent a holiday&lt;/a&gt; in the Loire Valley last year, and it made a great impression on me. I'd like to go back. It sounds incredible, but it hasn't changed all that much since Balzac described it at the beginning (?) of the 19th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EG has a more modern feel to it than the contemporaneous &lt;a href="http://blog.tlocke.org.uk/2010/08/jane-eyre.html"&gt;Jane Eyre&lt;/a&gt;. Why more modern? I don't know. I don't get paid to write this stuff you know. Apart from the ads, but they're very small beer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the story itself. It's a bit of a cautionary tale in a way. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middlemarch#Characters"&gt;Casaubon&lt;/a&gt; in Middlemarch is a warning to me. I try to avoid things becoming a Key To Mythologies. In the same way, the figure of Grandet might help me to curb my miserly tendencies. The thing is, I kind of admire his cunning, and he did create wealth through the diligent management of his land and assets. He put the accumulation of wealth and love of money above everything. Not good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The waste in the film has to be stored for 100,000 years before it decays to a non-radioactive substance. The experts say it can stay for around 100 years on the surface, but beyond that it becomes impossible to predict what might happen. The solution is to bury it deep in the rock so that it could only be exposed by people with the technology to understand the dangers of radiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My prediction is that we'll be able to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_transmutation"&gt;transmute&lt;/a&gt; radioactive waste into harmless elements in a few decades.

&lt;p&gt;People say he's a Gothic writer. What does that mean? Is it people who put black stuff around their eyes? I went to a Halloween party last night (I know it's not Halloween yet, but it's fine to have it early). I met Kazim in Bath and bought some beer. Incidentally, I picked up a box of 4 Asahi bottles and the cardboard somehow tore and they smashed on the floor of Waitrose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Beer" src="/images/2010/28647_p.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stood there gormlessly; Kazim claimed to have seen it coming. A Waitrose guy came and cleared it up. I apologized and slunk off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, you can see on the label it says Super Dry. Is this trying to cash in on the popularity of the clothing label?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Superdry" src="/images/2010/superdry.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well what I was trying to say before you distracted me was that for the Halloween party I put on white face paint, with black bits round the eyes. Kazim didn't do any dressing up at all. I didn't now how to put the black bits on. How is it done? I didn't look cool or scary, I looked like a Panda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book! The book! It was nice and long and I like the fact that the science is all plausible. It's a good sign when you want a book to carry on going. I dislike anything with the supernatural in it. It just makes me angry.

My economic hackles always rise at government job creation schemes. Call me old fashioned, but productive jobs are created when there's a genuine demand for goods and services, and companies need people to fulfil that demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government spending is only useful for creating the infrastructure for the private sector (the police, army, NHS, schools etc.), government can't generate wealth itself. It's the private sector that creates real wealth. Too much government means the private sector can't support it, and the nation ends up in debt. Too little government and the private sector doesn't have the infrastructure to survive. Government can *never* create productive jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't even get me started on the perverse incentives of the Green Deal. A few months ago, I insulated my roof. Now, as I understand it, I will be forced by law to pay extra for my electricity, in order to subsidise those without insulation. Not fair, and an example of big government sapping the initiative of the individual.&lt;/p&gt;

I phoned Velux and they explained that there was a manufacturing fault in some of their smaller windows. The fault means that the argon between the panes leaks out and somehow the pressure inside becomes lower than outside, and the inner pane implodes. Velux were pretty good, and they said they'd come round on October 11th and replace the glazing in &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; of my windows without any charge.

&lt;p&gt;In most books, the world is opened up via the characters, they know more than the reader and gradually reveal it. The power of Remains Of The Day and NLMG lies in the fact that you know more than the characters, and the world you know is gradually revealed to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of ROTD, the distance the characters have to travel is historical, and with NLMG the barrier that the characters face is institutional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it couldn't be like that, but I wanted the protagonists to recognize and overcome their abuse. The fact that they didn't is scarily realistic. The question that this book shouts to me is, 'are we being abused in some way without properly recognizing it?'&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="book-review"></category></entry><entry><title>Don't do that, it's against the law!

&lt;p&gt;As I see it, the world can be divided into physical, and informational things. Or rivalrous and non-rivalrous if you prefer. Examples of physical things are cars or a cakes. If I have it, you can't. Information on the other hand can be copied, so if I give you a copy of the information, I don't lose anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different rules apply depending on whether something's physical or information. For physical things money works well. Also, you can have ownership, and therefore theft. For information things, money doesn't work, and nor does ownership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's been a recent flap because some products (music, films, software, books, newspapers) have moved over from the realm of physical to that of informational. In the old days of music, you had to buy a record or tape (or a wax cylinder!) and so the music industry worked by selling those physical things. Now, with advancing technology, music has moved over into the information domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the old school record companies aren't willing to recognize this shift. They want to carry on as they did in the old days when music was physical. How can they carry on pretending music is still physical, when now it's information? Well, not easily. That's why they have used their considerable lobbying power to bring in draconian laws to force people to behave as if music is still rivalrous. And the result is ACTA and the Digital Economy Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why am I not too worried about this? Well, it's so clearly a dead-end for record companies. A new economy, and way of doing business will spring up that isn't fighting against technology, but using it. For example, I expect bands will license their music to allow people to freely play, copy and modify it. But they will charge money for the physical bit, gigs, merchandising, public appearances etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've concentrated on music, but the same goes for all those things moving from analogue to digital. I'm against ACTA and the Digital Economy Act, but I think it's a waste of energy to fight them since they are doomed to fail anyway. Let's use our energy to make a success of the new ways of doing things.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Cleveland Pools, Bath</title><link href="/cleveland-pools-bath.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-09-16T22:06:00+01:00</published><updated>2010-09-16T22:06:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-09-16:/cleveland-pools-bath.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Bill for organizing a visit to &lt;a href="http://www.clevelandpools.org.uk/"&gt;Cleveland Pools&lt;/a&gt; lido in Bath on Saturday.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. The requirement that embedded generators on the distribution network record&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sub-hourly metered generation data and make this freely available to the regulator, Ofgem, who should in turn put this into the public domain. At present this information is not collected.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free public release of sub-hourly metered generation output data for each and every individual electricity generator in the United Kingdom, whether subsidized or unsubsidized. Currently, only part of this information is collected, and what exists is only available on subscription and for restricted and confidential use.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full, free, and public disclosure of data relating to the Balancing Mechanism, including all participants in the market, and their utilization by National Grid. This&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;material is not at present available to the public, and since costs in this area are set to rise significantly, in large part due to the Government’s renewables policy, there is a pressing need to improve public scrutiny.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of points;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Football is a lot more heavy hitting than football; &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn4534-american-footballers-endure-car-crash-blows.html"&gt;http://www.newscientist.com/&lt;wbr&gt;article/dn4534-american-&lt;wbr&gt;footballers-endure-car-crash-&lt;wbr&gt;blows.html&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why isn’t boxing banned? Or contact in ice hockey, rugby, football, judo, karate, wrestling, etc. It isn’t to do with lack of education re head injuries.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banning heading in football is the equivalent to banning football as we know it. It will become a different game. The sport is so popular and the head injuries so mild compared with many other sports that it will never be banned!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found that ivy acted as a thermal blanket, warming up walls by an average of 15 per cent in cold weather and cooling the surface temperature of the wall in hot weather by an average of 36 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excellent! That's the reason &lt;a href="/ivy-watch-2.html"&gt;I'm growing it&lt;/a&gt; on the
walls of my house.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ivy was also found to absorb some of the harmful pollutants in the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not keen on that bit.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walls where ivy was growing were less prone to the damaging effects of freezing temperatures, temperature fluctuations, pollution and salts than exposed walls without ivy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well that's just a bonus!&lt;/p&gt;

At national and EU level, we have a mechanism for avoiding tragedies of the commons. We can pass laws and regulate the commons. For example, in the UK one can't tip mercury into a river without being subject to severe penalties, so pollution of rivers isn't an intractable problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem comes with tragedies of the global commons (eg. climate change) where there is no democratic government. That's why &lt;a href="http://www.polifesto.com/policies/11/"&gt;I'm in favour of a world government&lt;/a&gt;. If a world government were to be established we could impose a global carbon tax and so reduce our carbon emissions to an acceptable level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://food.change.org/blog/view/russias_pavlovsk_seed_vault_threatened_by_real_estate_developers"&gt;&lt;img alt="Plant" src="http://change-production.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/wordpress_copies/food/2010/08/plant.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Moody's 'Greed vs. Survival: Which Prevails?', the problem is that the benefits of selling the land are at national level, but the costs are at global level. Whenever that's the case, things should be decided at global level, but there's no mechanism for that. Bring on the world government!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Twitter and Burglary</title><link href="/please-rob-me.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-08-15T11:50:00+01:00</published><updated>2010-08-15T11:50:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-08-15:/please-rob-me.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8507528.stm"&gt;tweeted about Foursquare&lt;/a&gt;, and @icklemichael &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/icklemichael/status/20289504006"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many others, J12H classes privacy as a freedom. I don't. Freedoms to me are freedom of speech and freedom of association. Also important to me is democracy. The Tabula of the book are undemocratic criminals. I also regard the Harlequins as criminals. If this were real-life I'd say, 'a plague on both your houses'.&lt;/p&gt;

He's a great fan of Robert Goddard. Having said that he's recently mentioned that he needs to broaden his reading beyond Goddard. Dad's quite a slow reader, but my mum read quickly. Anyway, while I was at dad's house I picked up Hand In Glove. In the same way as a real paper copy of the Sunday Times, this book reminded me of my youth, the days before the internet came along. Goddard isn't into computers. Written in 1992, Hand In Glove has a totally pre-internet feel to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is well written, all the Goddards are. There are nice sub-plots and things move along in an exciting, page turning way. Maurice's character is revealed cleverly. Call me a social revolutionary, but I find Goddard's world slightly stereotyped. It reinforces a certain middle-class view of the world. I've read a few Goddards before, and because they're so enjoyable I hope to read more.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="book-review"></category></entry><entry><title>Imprimatur 017</title><link href="/imprimatur-017.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-08-11T22:03:00+01:00</published><updated>2010-08-11T22:03:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-08-11:/imprimatur-017.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Someone requested that Imprimatur support HTTPS requests.

&lt;p&gt;One observation; there are a lot of long silences. There's a Borat sketch where he says, 'there will now be a 10 minute silence'. Of course, this is a very long time to be silent. Normally it's a two minute silence. In Jane Eyre there are lots of really long silences. When another author would say there was moment's pause, Charlotte Bronte has a interval of several minutes! Check if you don't believe me. The most egregious instance is when there is the objection to the marriage, and Rochester pauses for &lt;em&gt;15 minutes&lt;/em&gt; while speaking :-0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put this to my friend, and she said it's because when the Brontes were growing up, they weren't allowed to speak at mealtimes, so silences were ingrained in their lives. Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jane is trying to find Rochester, she avoids immediately asking the first person who could tell her, saying, 'To prolong doubt is to prolong hope'. So true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sure whole Phds have been devoted to Jane's relationship to nature. It's anthropomorphic and idealized. I burst out laughing when she said in all seriousness that, 'birds were faithful to their mates'. When I see wildlife, I see, in Hobbes' words, 'a war of all against all', a pitiless, endless battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to read Wuthering Heights now.

Put it this way, I'm sure they didn't employ a team of architects to do the film's special effects!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I'm giving the impression that I didn't like the film. That's not true, I totally enjoyed it. I've recommended it to friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the idea that if you die in a dream then you 'wake up' back to 'reality' is nonsense.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pamela Flitton&lt;/em&gt; is doing the best. The only problem is that I have to keep cutting it back to prevent her from encroaching on my neighbour's part of the wall. The other only problem is that she's started to grow onto the patio door, so I've had to cut her back.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ted Jeavons&lt;/em&gt; grows against the back of the garage wall. Getting along nicely, but won't really help in insulating the house.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Ivy 3" src="/images/2010/2010-08-08_14_35_29.jpg"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't shown you &lt;em&gt;Jessica Biel&lt;/em&gt; before, but she's the most important ivy. Unfortunately she's not doing well. Why? What nutrients does ivy need to thrive? Btw, after months of sunshine my lawn is looking like it's in a very sorry state :-(  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Ivy 4" src="/images/2010/2010-08-08_14_33_52.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jane Eyre&lt;/em&gt; is the second most important ivy plant, and so I'm pleased that she's steadily covering the wall.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

    x = 0

    def f():
      return x

    def g():
      x = 1
      return f()

Calling `g()` would return 1. In most languages with lexical scoping you can declare a variable with the same name, at a more local scope. With Klop you can't, and I think that this would make programs more readable.

DNOs are a regulated monopoly, but each customer can choose their supplier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've read Notes On A Scandal, and Everything You Know and blogged about them on Yahoo! but Yahoo! deleted my email (which I didn't mind) and blog (which I was upset about) after not using my email for some time. I'm still angry at Yahoo! for deleting it. Will Google ever delete my blog? Please don't! I should really back it up...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of being angry, I'm annoyed at losing my copy of Jane Eyre. The thing is that I keep on losing my things. I've lost a coat, hat and sunglasses a few weeks ago. I'm always losing stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, back to the book. I read it over the weekend, and I just had to keep reading it. Heller is incredibly clever, she is witty, sassy and perceptive. The phrase 'caustic wit', comes to mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't get above yourself with Heller, she'd soon cut you down to size.

&lt;p&gt;He told me that after thinking long and hard about the problem caused by the one-way street, he came to the conclusion that the only solution was to have a lop-sided roundabout. So he drew it up and showed it to his team leader. The team leader saw how unusual it looked and made to explain how it should be improved, but then stopped because he couldn't actually think of a better way of doing it. So the team leader passed it on to his boss Brian Raistrick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When assessing the merits of a highway design, Raistrick would hold the plan horizontally, level with his eyes, and mentally drive through all the routes, turning the paper as he went. Again, Raistrick found my dad's design unusual, but couldn't find anything wrong with it, and so it was built.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Cricketing In Obscurity</title><link href="/cricketing-in-obscurity.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-07-07T21:57:00+01:00</published><updated>2010-07-07T21:57:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-07-07:/cricketing-in-obscurity.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I heard someone on the radio saying of the England cricket team, 'I think the team don't mind that their success isn't attracting media attention, they're just happy to get on with the job', or words to that effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most jobs that's true, but the aim of a professional sports person is to entertain the masses, which entails attracting media attention. So from a business point of view it's a problem that people aren't paying attention. Of course, if they're enjoying themselves then I'd argue that that's an end in itself.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Silk</title><link href="/silk.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-07-04T17:19:00+01:00</published><updated>2010-07-04T17:19:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-07-04:/silk.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/71/Alessandro_baricco_silk_pb.jpg/185px-Alessandro_baricco_silk_pb.jpg"&gt;Silk&lt;/a&gt; is like a small, neatly wrapped Japanese package.

your brown skin shining in the sun&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you know you're walking real slow&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you got your top pulled down,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Do you know why Jean Berbeck stopped talking?"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The privacy issue is important, but my reaction to it is opposite to that of John Twelve Hawks. Some time ago I read about someone who retaliated against CCTV cameras by filming the places that were filming him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put it another way, JTH is disturbed by the asymmetry between the watcher and the watched. He solves it by trying to avoid being watched. I too am concerned at this asymmetry, but I think it should be solved by me being able to watch the corporations and governments as closely as they watch me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="book-review"></category></entry><entry><title>Rainbows End</title><link href="/rainbows-end.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-06-23T20:20:00+01:00</published><updated>2010-06-23T20:20:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-06-23:/rainbows-end.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A Fire Upon The Deep and A Deepness In The Sky by Vernor Vinge are among my top sci-fi books.

He covered many aspects, but one idea he talked about was that for safety reasons a superhuman AI should be developed in virtual reality. He said that the most important thing was that information shouldn't be allowed to leak in. Leaking out was less dangerous. A bit like the one-way mirrors they have in police interview rooms. The argument was that if information could leak out, people on the outside could be manipulated by the AI to free it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting idea, but I'm sceptical that we really can develop AIs safely. Perhaps the best we can do is to try to instil a moral principle that the strong shouldn't harm the weak. Since today's strong will be tomorrow's weak, as AIs gain in sophistication it should be in the strong's interest to uphold this principle. The problem is that it's a principle that can never be enforced by the weak, and so we'll always have to rely on the strong being responsible.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>The Vengeance Of Rome</title><link href="/vengeance-of-rome.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-05-28T22:28:00+01:00</published><updated>2010-05-28T22:28:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-05-28:/vengeance-of-rome.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I started off with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vengeance_of_Rome"&gt;The Vengeance Of Rome&lt;/a&gt;, the last of the Pyat tetralogy.

There's a lot of irony in the book. You have to be cleverer than I am to pick it all up. I don't yet have a settled view of the protagonist.

Entitled 'Electoral dysfunction: Why democracy is always unfair', it argues that due to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem"&gt;Arrow's Impossibility Theorem&lt;/a&gt;, you can never have a perfect voting system. The problem with this argument is that Arrow's Theorem only applies to voting systems where the candidates are put into an ordered list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_voting"&gt;range voting&lt;/a&gt; system, the voter gives each candidate points out of 10 (or some other number). All the points for each candidate are added up, and the candidate with the highest number of points is the winner. Since range voting doesn't require an ordered list, Arrow's Theorem doesn't apply.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Indeed, although the version of range voting on th...</title><link href="/post-8807232528587314551.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-05-06T18:24:00+01:00</published><updated>2010-05-06T18:24:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-05-06:/post-8807232528587314551.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Indeed, although the version of range voting on the website you refer to has the 'no opinion' option, which complicates things unnecessarily.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Indeed, although the version of range voting on the website you refer to has the 'no opinion' option, which complicates things unnecessarily.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Gas Usage In Our House</title><link href="/gas-usage-in-our-house.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-05-04T23:18:00+01:00</published><updated>2010-05-04T23:18:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-05-04:/gas-usage-in-our-house.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Gas Usage" src="/images/2010/gas_usage.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Gas Usage" src="/images/2010/gas_usage.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Eco-bling</title><link href="/eco-bling.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-05-04T23:02:00+01:00</published><updated>2010-05-04T23:02:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-05-04:/eco-bling.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Went to a bracing Science Cafe given by Doug King.

&lt;h4&gt;Labour&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gordon Brown has made it clear that to get Britain's economy on its feet he'd continue wildly taxing and spending. I disagree with Brown, and agree with the Conservatives that we need to pay off our debt. I think this is such an important difference that I find myself unable to vote Labour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Conservative&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it's fantastic that they're against raising the National Insurance tax, I'm all for stopping taxing the poor. I also support their economic policy of cutting public spending, and reducing the debt as quickly as possible. I'm appalled by the Tory EU euro-phobia. Why can't they all be like Ken Clarke?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Liberal Democrats&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like the Lib Dem policy of raising income tax threshold. I wish they'd go further and &lt;a href="http://www.polifesto.com/policies/16/"&gt;stop taxing the poor&lt;/a&gt; entirely. Electoral reform is a key aim of the Lib Dems, as it is for me. I'm &lt;a href="http://www.polifesto.com/policies/3/"&gt;in favour of range voting&lt;/a&gt;. I'm a euro-federalist, I want a united states of Europe as a step on the way to a &lt;a href="http://www.polifesto.com/policies/11/"&gt;world government&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a shame that &lt;a href="/trevor-carbins-just-one-minute-survey.html"&gt;my exchange with Trevor Carbin&lt;/a&gt; revealed the liberal democrats to have some economically illiterate policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labour: Fiscal incontinence. Conservatives: First past the post europhobes. Lib Dems: Better tax system, electoral reform, europhiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So on Thursday I'll be voting Liberal Democrat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

rather obtuse.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You say that "One of the best things about them was that they provided&lt;br&gt;
information. Now with the internet I can do all that myself". This is&lt;br&gt;
true to an extent, but a lot of the campaigning work that we do is based&lt;br&gt;
on original research that we have undertaken - for example our research&lt;br&gt;
and exposes on the palm oil trade in Southeast Asia&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/media/reports/caught-red-handed-nestl%C3%A9%20-sinar-mas-and-palm-oil"&gt;http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/&lt;wbr&gt;media/reports/caught-red-&lt;wbr&gt;handed-nestl%C3%A9&lt;br&gt;
-sinar-mas-and-palm-oil&lt;/a&gt; and cattle ranching in the Amazon&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/blog/forests/slaughtering-amazon-20090529"&gt;http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/&lt;wbr&gt;blog/forests/slaughtering-&lt;wbr&gt;amazon-20090529&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
or our work on decentralised energy&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/media/reports/powering-london-into-the-21st%20-century"&gt;http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/&lt;wbr&gt;media/reports/powering-london-&lt;wbr&gt;into-the-21st&lt;br&gt;
-century&lt;/a&gt; - information and campaigning that you wouldn't find on the&lt;br&gt;
internet unless we'd put it there!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your say "Also, I don't think they like the same political ideas as me".&lt;br&gt;
I followed your link and found the manifesto link that covered items&lt;br&gt;
such as banning guns and legalizing prostitution, both of which are&lt;br&gt;
outside of our environmental remit. The only items on the list that&lt;br&gt;
were vaguely relevant to us were free market energy and free trade? We&lt;br&gt;
do work with privatised energy companies, for example the green energy&lt;br&gt;
scheme Juice that we set up with Npower, though we might argue that it's&lt;br&gt;
harder to enforce energy efficiency measures or investment in renewables&lt;br&gt;
with disparate private contractors focused on short term profit, rather&lt;br&gt;
than a centralized nationalised energy provider. There is loads of&lt;br&gt;
information on the pitfalls and challenges of free trade at&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international/campaigns/trade-and-the-environment"&gt;http://www.greenpeace.org/&lt;wbr&gt;international/campaigns/trade-and-the-environment&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly you say that "I'm concerned that Greenpeace is more like a&lt;br&gt;
proprietary software company but I'd like it to be more like an&lt;br&gt;
OpenSource project" Unfortunately I have no idea what you mean by this.&lt;br&gt;
We very openly share information and campaign skills via our web sites,&lt;br&gt;
local groups and campaign co-operations with numerous other NGOs and&lt;br&gt;
local communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a good point about research, if Greenpeace don't do the research it won't be there to be read on the net. I'm not sure my reasons for leaving are entirely cogent, but I feel better for it!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>The Real Benefit Of The Lib Dem Tax Policy</title><link href="/real-benefit-of-lib-dem-tax-policy.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-04-26T20:51:00+01:00</published><updated>2010-04-26T20:51:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-04-26:/real-benefit-of-lib-dem-tax-policy.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I read Stephanie Flanders religiously, and it's rare that I make a criticism of her writing.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that the main point of the policy is to remove the benefit trap. At the moment it's financially beneficial for a lot of people to stay on benefits rather than get a job, because any job they could hope to get wouldn't give them an income greater than their benefits. If the income from a job isn't taxed so heavily though, it means that the benefit trap is removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the main point of the Liberal Democrats' raising of the threshold is to reduce unemployment, and thus reduce the benefits bill and increase GDP.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd encourage the Liberal Democrats to go further, and &lt;a href="http://www.polifesto.com/policies/16/versions/40/"&gt;stop taxing the poor&lt;/a&gt; altogether.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Transcendent</title><link href="/transcendent.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-04-20T20:47:00+01:00</published><updated>2010-04-20T20:47:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-04-20:/transcendent.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In this brilliant book by Stephen Baxter, immortality is tackled properly.

It won't be long before ageing is cured, and yet so few books, even sci-fi, take longevity seriously. Baxter describes how the undying don't have art in their environment, one is appalled by even the greatest piece of art after long enough. True, even the best song can pall after you've listened to it often enough on Spotify. You don't have to be immortal to feel like that, I find anything that's repeated becomes an infuriating burden.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0d/Transcendent_-_Baxter2.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="Book Cover" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0d/Transcendent_-_Baxter2.JPG"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But this book is about more than the undying. Coalescences are a recurring theme. This is where humans take the same evolutionary route as ants and wasps etc. They have a single breeding queen, and all the others work for the hive, in the knowledge that the hive shares the same genes as them. Perhaps we can see this happening in our society. Eggs are routinely frozen, stored and implanted into other women, so matriarchs can have babies that are genetically theirs without having to bear them. Housing is controlled by the older generation, so they can persuade their daughters to look after their siblings instead of having children themselves.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all suffering, pain and all wrongs are to be wiped away, then ultimately that means that humanity, life and so the universe itself must not exist. In other words a perfect world is a word where nothing exists. In the end the protagonist, Michael Poole has this question put to him and comes to the same conclusion as me, he opts for life and an imperfect world.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="book-review"></category></entry><entry><title>Leaving Greenpeace</title><link href="/leaving-greenpeace.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-04-18T22:49:00+01:00</published><updated>2010-04-18T22:49:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-04-18:/leaving-greenpeace.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I joined Greenpeace as a teenager in the eighties, but now I'm thinking of leaving them.

&lt;p&gt;Dear Mr Locke  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your letters to the ORR and the DfT have been drawn to my attention. We did run additional special trains for the Bath Half Marathon. Three extra services ran in the morning, one from Swindon, one from Bristol and one from Westbury.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These extra trains were to be boosted by running the 1009 from Bradford on Avon as a four car unit. This did not happen. This was not due to a lack of planning by the Special Events team, but was due to an error made by our Control team. They misread the unit allocation and brought a two-car unit out instead of a four car. This is not acceptable and is being addressed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can fully appreciate your annoyance and disappointment. This was not the service we planned and I apologise.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Great Western have made significant progress in improving our customers’ experience on our trains. Performance is at record levels and we have been able to improve capacity and comfort on the West of England trains. This makes this sort of mistake even more galling.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am determined that we do better and you have my assurance that this mistake is one that will not happen again.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yours sincerely  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm pleased that FGW appear to take this seriously. What I'd really like though is a separate railway line from Trowbridge to Bath, and then there'd be proper choice and competition! In the absence of that, we have to rely on the regulator to apply pseudo-competitive pressure.

&lt;p&gt;A more serious problem was his policy of forcing banks to lend to businesses when they didn't want to. Banks should make their own decisions about who to lend to. Those that get it wrong should be allowed to fail, they shouldn't be bailed out by the tax payer.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Scarf</title><link href="/scarf.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-04-12T22:51:00+01:00</published><updated>2010-04-12T22:51:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-04-12:/scarf.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been trying to get a scarf like this for ages.

&lt;p&gt;The syllogism that the Tories trot out is that married couples are good for society, so if we pay people to get married there will be more married people and therefore a better society. The flaw in this reasoning is that &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation"&gt;correlation is not causation&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Fair enough, though I don't share your enthusiasm for Ofsted. Of course there are dangers as you've pointed out, but the alternative to action is inaction and if you leave a depressed economy to cure itself that can take a long time. Yes the government sometimes gets ripped off by private sector contractors and it's important to watch that closely. We're proposing a policy that stimulates employment, keeps money circulating in the real economy, and achieves environmental objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm doubtful whether increased public spending of any sort helps the economy, as it increases the national debt, which increases the ongoing burden of interest payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let's assume you are going to have a spending spree of tax payers' money (or stimulus as some call it). The least bad way to do it is to reduce taxation, reducing national insurance perhaps. This sets more money free to earn greater returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst way is to spend the money on some government scheme or other. Governments shouldn't be in the business of picking winners or funding enterprises. If that does happen, then the business in question will become addicted to state aid, and forget about providing goods and services to customers, and a downward spiral ensues.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Diary Of A Country Priest</title><link href="/diary-of-country-priest.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-04-05T20:57:00+01:00</published><updated>2010-04-05T20:57:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-04-05:/diary-of-country-priest.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;By the end, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diary_of_a_Country_Priest"&gt;Diary Of A Country Priest&lt;/a&gt; had moved me to tears.

&lt;p&gt;What about the doctor, Dr Delbende, that committed suicide? What are we to make of that? The doctor was an atheist, and a friend of the Priest of Torcy. The Priest of Ambricourt (the priest of the title, hereafter the PoA) went to see the doctor for a diagnosis, and detected that Belbende had a deeply wounded soul. When the Priest of Torcy talked to the PoA about Belbende after he died, the PoA said that hearing it gave him the most pain he had been in in his life. Why? Was it because he felt guilty because he perhaps could have helped? I don't know.

Subject: Impending war in Iraq  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Andrew Murrison,  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one of your constituents, I am writing to express my view on the impending war in Iraq.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that the overriding concern is that any action must have the full support of the UN. In this case the UN has not unambiguously sanctioned war, and so I would urge you to vote against the UK going to war with Iraq.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regards,  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By now you will no know that I voted against the government again but unfortunately overnight events have overtaken us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've got one of his leaflets in front of me now, entitled Trowbridge Residents' Survey. This post is my reply to the first item on this survey, the NHS.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.andrewmurrison.co.uk/images/3%20crop.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Murrison" src="http://www.andrewmurrison.co.uk/images/3%20crop.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that &lt;a href="http://www.polifesto.com/policies/18/"&gt;any organization should be able to set up a hospital&lt;/a&gt; providing it meets the minimum standard of the regulator. The NHS should always be free at the point of use, so funding should follow the patient. The government should not have a monopoly on [providing]{style="font-style: italic;"} state funded health services. The patient should be given choice, to drive up standards.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leaflet says a Conservative proposal is [A new scheme to help older people insure against the cost of residential care so they do not have to sell their homes]{style="font-style: italic;"}. I think that residential care should be funded by the state, from general taxation, just like the NHS.  &lt;/p&gt;

I'm completely against price fixing, either by employers or employees, so if this was being carried out by the &lt;em&gt;Friendly Society of Agricultural Labourers&lt;/em&gt; then it had to be stopped.

&lt;a href="/inadequate-trains-for-bath-half.html"&gt;wrote to the Office Of Rail Regulation&lt;/a&gt;, asking them to fine First Great Western for the shortage of carriages to take people to the Bath Half Marathon. Here's their reply:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Mr Locke  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your email of 7 March about the 10:09 train from Bradford-on-Avon to Bath Spa on 7 March which was unable to accomodate all the passengers travelling to the Bath half marathon.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The train operators provide their services under the terms of their franchise agreements with the Department for Transport (DfT). The DfT is responsible for specifying these terms, monitoring compliance and taking enforcement action where necessary. I therefore suggest you address your enquiry to edmund.cullen@dft.gsi.gov.uk.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usual procedure for making a complaint about the service provided by a train operator is:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write to the train operator concerned - presumably, in this case, First Great Western whose contact details can be found on its website at http://www.firstgreatwestern.co.uk/ContactUs.aspx.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not satisfied with the train operator's response, contact Passenger Focus which is sponsored by the DfT to represent passenger interests and to act as Britain's rail passenger watchdog. Contact details for Passenger Focus can be found at http://www.passengerfocus.org.uk/contact-us/.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can post this reply on your blog if you wish but you may want to wait for something more substantive from DfT/First Great Western/Passenger Focus.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yours sincerely  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web:www.rail-reg.gov.uk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I've emailed the DfT saying:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi, I was given your address by the Office of Rail Regulation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hordes of people were unable to board the 10:09 from Bradford On Avon&lt;br&gt;
to Bath Spa on 7th March. The train was crowded because of the&lt;br&gt;
entirely predictable Bath Half Marathon. A four carriage train should&lt;br&gt;
have been put on, rather than the two that turned up.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please would you fine the operator.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, please let me know if it's not okay to post your reply on my blog.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks,  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tony Locke&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I'll let you know what the reply is...&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Trevor Carbin Responds</title><link href="/trevor-carbin-responds.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-03-20T09:27:00+00:00</published><updated>2010-03-20T09:27:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-03-20:/trevor-carbin-responds.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;To his credit, &lt;a href="http://trevorcarbin.org.uk/"&gt;Trevor Carbin&lt;/a&gt; has responded to my &lt;a href="/trevor-carbins-just-one-minute-survey.html"&gt;previous comments&lt;/a&gt;. Here is our dialogue in full:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A five-year programme to insulate every school and hospital.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; I believe that a decision like this is for each school or hospital individually, not something that should be dictated by central government …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;To his credit, &lt;a href="http://trevorcarbin.org.uk/"&gt;Trevor Carbin&lt;/a&gt; has responded to my &lt;a href="/trevor-carbins-just-one-minute-survey.html"&gt;previous comments&lt;/a&gt;. Here is our dialogue in full:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A five-year programme to insulate every school and hospital.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; I believe that a decision like this is for each school or hospital individually, not something that should be dictated by central government. Furthermore, it's not right that government has a monopoly on providing state funded schools and hospitals. Please end this monopoly and give the public choice, so that standards are raised.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trevor:&lt;/strong&gt; We do support as much independence as possible for schools and hospitals. The assumption is that as this programme would be beneficial they would accept it and would not decline the opportunity to cut their heating bills and reduce energy use. I don't suppose it would be forced on any school/hospital which didn't want it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; Schools and hospitals should be given the choice on how they spend money given to them, it shouldn't be dictated by central government. Under your scheme they can either spend the money on insulation or not at all. What if a school has already spent some of its budget on good insulation in previous years, but wanted to spend your new money on a new teacher? Why are you going stop them?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trevor:&lt;/strong&gt; I wouldn't describe the current state education system as a monopoly as other parties than the government are involved.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; It's a monopoly because only the government can provide state funded schooling. The monopoly could be ended by allowing any organization to set up a school, and they would receive state funding for each child whose parents decide to send them to that school. Please give parents the choice and end the state monopoly.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trevor:&lt;/strong&gt; Where there's taxpayer funding there needs to be political oversight, though preferably more at local rather than at national level.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; There does need to be oversight, and this would be provided by Ofsted.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trevor:&lt;/strong&gt; The government has been promoting choice in education but I'm not convinced it's driven up overall standards.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; They haven't given us choice in education, we're still stuck with the state monopoly.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Funding insulation and energy efficiency for a million homes, (with a £1,000 subsidy for a million more).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Me]{style="font-weight: bold;"}: This is a terrible idea, as it rewards the feckless householder who hasn't insulated her house, and is no help to the responsible person who has already spent their money on insulation. Please don't do this. Instead spend the money on *paying off* the nation's debts, not adding to them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Trevor]{style="font-weight: bold;"}: It's not free money - the initial cost is repaid over time by the householder via their fuel bills.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Me]{style="font-weight: bold;"}: The problem is that we all pay, but the person who has already insulated their house doesn't benefit. This policy punishes good behaviour, and rewards bad behaviour. Please withdraw it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Trevor]{style="font-weight: bold;"}: Reductions in fuel imports would benefit the national economy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Me]{style="font-weight: bold;"}: Not necessarily! This is economic illiteracy! The amount saved by not importing fuels could be outweighed by the amount we gain by importing them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[3. Building 40,000 extra zero-carbon social houses.]{style="font-style: italic;"}  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Me]{style="font-weight: bold;"}: What do you mean by zero-carbon? I suspect you subscribe to the bonkers idea that every house should be self sufficient in renewable energy. Why shouldn't I buy cheap renewable electricity rather than expensively generate it myself. Self-sufficiency is a bogus aim.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Trevor]{style="font-weight: bold;"}: 'Zero carbon' in this sense means not requiring fossil fuels for space heating. The building standards required to achieve that pay for themselves in energy savings. Yes, total self-sufficiency is probably not practicable for most individual homes but that's not a reason for not moving towards it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Me]{style="font-weight: bold;"}: Self sufficiency is not a desirable aim. How can you so lightly dismiss the principle of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage"&gt;comparative advantage&lt;/a&gt;? I say again, 'Why shouldn't I buy cheap renewable electricity rather than expensively generate it myself?'  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[4. Buying 700 new train carriages.]{style="font-style: italic;"}  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Me]{style="font-weight: bold;"}: First the bank bail-out, then the train operator bail-out. The train operating companies should be buying new carriages *not* the taxpayer. Really, you can't get enough of perverse incentives can you?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Trevor]{style="font-weight: bold;"}: Again they wouldn't simply be gift-wrapped and handed over. There would have to be detailed negotiations with the companies on how the carriages were to be used and how the cost of the investment was to be repaid. Meanwhile the potential benefit for the travelling public on lines currently suffering from under-investment and overcrowding would be significant.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Me]{style="font-weight: bold;"}: UK rail companies are already subsidised by about £5bn / year. This should be withdrawn. I commute by train every day between Trowbridge where I live and Bath where I work. I look to a future government to be tough with these train operating companies, not to give them any more money. You say that there will be detailed negotiations. I think you're being incredibly naive. These companies will take the money and run. They're much better at negotiating than civil servants. The rail companies should be given the message that the way to make money is by serving customers better, not through government handouts.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[5. Re-opening old railway lines and stations, opening new ones, and electrifying the Great Western and Midland mainlines.]{style="font-style: italic;"}  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, I don't have an opinion on this.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[6. Installing energy and money saving smart meters in every home within five years.]{style="font-style: italic;"}  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Me]{style="font-weight: bold;"}: I can't believe you've been lobbied into funding the energy companies. They're *private companies* please don't give them our money, please please.... What do you mean by smart meters? Do you mean that meter readings are collected remotely so that meter readers don't have to go out in their vans and read meters? If this is cheaper, then energy companies will install them of their own accord, if not, then why do it?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Trevor]{style="font-weight: bold;"}: Smart meters have potential benefits both for suppliers and consumers. If the energy companies install them in their own way they would tend to maximise the former possibly at the expense of the latter. By intervening in the process the cost and energy savings for householders can be increased. The most immediate effect is that when we're made aware of the running costs of appliances we tend to waste less energy. There's also potential for more off-peak tariffs and even for switching between suppliers to get a cheaper rate.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me&lt;/strong&gt;: I agree with this, but it can be done through the regulator, Ofgem, mandating that all energy data that's recorded for billing is made freely available to the customer. Government doesn't have to shell out our cash to energy companies to achieve what you describe above; you've fallen prey to their lobbying. It's your job to resist big, politically well-connected companies that are trying to get a handout from government.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="&amp;#109;&amp;#97;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#58;&amp;#118;&amp;#111;&amp;#116;&amp;#101;&amp;#102;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#116;&amp;#114;&amp;#101;&amp;#118;&amp;#64;&amp;#121;&amp;#97;&amp;#104;&amp;#111;&amp;#111;&amp;#46;&amp;#99;&amp;#111;&amp;#46;&amp;#117;&amp;#107;"&gt;&amp;#118;&amp;#111;&amp;#116;&amp;#101;&amp;#102;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#116;&amp;#114;&amp;#101;&amp;#118;&amp;#64;&amp;#121;&amp;#97;&amp;#104;&amp;#111;&amp;#111;&amp;#46;&amp;#99;&amp;#111;&amp;#46;&amp;#117;&amp;#107;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="&amp;#109;&amp;#97;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#58;&amp;#116;&amp;#108;&amp;#111;&amp;#99;&amp;#107;&amp;#101;&amp;#64;&amp;#116;&amp;#108;&amp;#111;&amp;#99;&amp;#107;&amp;#101;&amp;#46;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#103;&amp;#46;&amp;#117;&amp;#107;"&gt;&amp;#116;&amp;#108;&amp;#111;&amp;#99;&amp;#107;&amp;#101;&amp;#64;&amp;#116;&amp;#108;&amp;#111;&amp;#99;&amp;#107;&amp;#101;&amp;#46;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#103;&amp;#46;&amp;#117;&amp;#107;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="&amp;#109;&amp;#97;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#58;&amp;#47;&amp;#116;&amp;#108;&amp;#111;&amp;#99;&amp;#107;&amp;#101;&amp;#64;&amp;#116;&amp;#108;&amp;#111;&amp;#99;&amp;#107;&amp;#101;&amp;#46;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#103;&amp;#46;&amp;#117;&amp;#107;"&gt;&amp;#47;&amp;#116;&amp;#108;&amp;#111;&amp;#99;&amp;#107;&amp;#101;&amp;#64;&amp;#116;&amp;#108;&amp;#111;&amp;#99;&amp;#107;&amp;#101;&amp;#46;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#103;&amp;#46;&amp;#117;&amp;#107;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="&amp;#109;&amp;#97;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#58;&amp;#47;&amp;#118;&amp;#111;&amp;#116;&amp;#101;&amp;#102;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#116;&amp;#114;&amp;#101;&amp;#118;&amp;#64;&amp;#121;&amp;#97;&amp;#104;&amp;#111;&amp;#111;&amp;#46;&amp;#99;&amp;#111;&amp;#46;&amp;#117;&amp;#107;"&gt;&amp;#47;&amp;#118;&amp;#111;&amp;#116;&amp;#101;&amp;#102;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#116;&amp;#114;&amp;#101;&amp;#118;&amp;#64;&amp;#121;&amp;#97;&amp;#104;&amp;#111;&amp;#111;&amp;#46;&amp;#99;&amp;#111;&amp;#46;&amp;#117;&amp;#107;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can't believe you've been lobbied into funding the energy companies. They're *private companies* please don't give them our money, please please.... What do you mean by smart meters? Do you mean that meter readings are collected remotely so that meter readers don't have to go out in their vans and read meters? If this is cheaper, then energy companies will install them of their own accord, if not, then why do it?  &lt;/p&gt;

It's a collection of essays by scientists, talking about their work and its implications.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a lot of interesting ideas in there. One thing that sticks in my mind is the research that shows that language affects how we perceive the world. In English there is only one word for the colour blue. In Russian there isn't a word for just blue, instead there's a word for light blue and a word for dark blue. In tests, Russian speakers can distinguish between shades of blue more quickly than English speakers.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoever controls language, controls how the world is perceived.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One essay was entitled, 'Why hasn't specialization lead to the Balkanization of science?' If I were asked that question, I'd say what the great David Deutsch said, that there's a competition between science getting broader (we know more and more facts) and unifying theories that explain these facts. For example Newton's laws of motion explained almost everything that moves in a few simple rules. That wasn't the answer that the author of the essay gave, which was still interesting in its own way.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="book-review"></category></entry><entry><title>The train company wasn't greedy enough.

I picked up Jostein Gaarder's Through A Glass, Darkly and was enraged by the smug Christianity of it all. I don't like the fantasy genre, but give me the Chronicles of Thomas Covenant Unbeliever over nauseating angels. The whole book is drearily pedagogic. He stands over us, serving up oily syrup (is there such a thing outside similie?) and expects us to give up our reason and accept souls and angels and God.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gradually dawned on me that Gaarder [actually believes]{style="font-style: italic;"} that souls enter a person when they're born, and leave when they die. Gaarder highlights the mystery of feelings and senses. This is a mystery that science hasn't yet explained. Gaarder turns this gap into an entranceway for God.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the standard 'God of the gaps' approach. It goes like this. Pick something that science hasn't explained yet, and attribute it to God. The problem is that science keeps moving forward, and God is in continual retreat. Examples:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big bang&lt;br&gt;
Consciousness&lt;br&gt;
Life  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a flaw of mine, but I don't like things that you're not supposed to take literally. It's okay if something has a literal truth, and then further truths on top of that. I never 'get' the deeper truths myself, but I can understand the idea. No, what I hate is this magical realism. And when it's combined with Christianity and complacent condescension it's enough to make me wretch.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give Gaarder credit, he does handle well the parents' relationship with the dying child, and their behaviour in that situation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I feel guilty at criticising a book. It's such an achievement to write a book, I salute anyone who does.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="book-review"></category></entry><entry><title>Reverse-engineering the world</title><link href="/reverse-engineering-world.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-03-04T21:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2010-03-04T21:30:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-03-04:/reverse-engineering-world.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I woke up and saw a chair.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physicists &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8461591.stm"&gt;experience their environment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They create theories to explain what they see.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engineers use these theories to create our environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physicists experience this environment...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, physics is the reverse-engineering of the environment. If we create the environment, we just get our own rules back. Even worse for virtual worlds.  &lt;/p&gt;

I always do a kilometre, and every odd numbered length is front crawl and every even numbered length alternates between breast stroke and back stroke.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like to lay down the law once and for all on how lanes should be used. No arguments, this is how it'll be. Lanes in the swimming pool are like lanes on the motorway. You swim along in the inside lane, and use the middle lane for overtaking. The outside lane is used for overtaking the overtakers. Got that?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't&lt;/strong&gt; overtake people &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; a lane. A single lane can only fit two people across.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't&lt;/strong&gt; feel that you have to stop at the end to let people past, they can overtake you using the middle lane.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't&lt;/strong&gt; feel frustrated if someone in front of you is too slow, simply overtake them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do&lt;/strong&gt; remonstrate with people who use the middle lane for going at a medium speed. The middle lane is only used for overtaking people in the inside lane.  &lt;/li&gt;

It was highly engaging. Anyway, I had to leave before I'd got more than a few pages in.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then some time later when I needed a book to read I went back to try and find it. I couldn't, so I got Exultant.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c6/Exultant-Baxter.JPG"&gt;&lt;img alt="Exultant" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c6/Exultant-Baxter.JPG"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well now I've got it all worked out. The book I originally started reading was &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendent_%28novel%29"&gt;Transcendent&lt;/a&gt;, the second in the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny%27s_Children"&gt;Destiny's Children&lt;/a&gt; series, but I ended up reading the second book in that series, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exultant_%28book%29"&gt;Exultant&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you still with me? Do you still care? Hey, wake up!!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are great ideas in Exultant. Baxter really is at the top of his game. This is the the first time I can remember that I've come across the idea of life existing at different stages of the universe's early life. In one extraordinary piece, there's a grand war across the whole of the universe between two ancient civilizations. After the saga is told, it is revealed that the universe is now 10cm across, and only a small fraction of a second has elapsed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as having stunning ideas, Baxter writes a good story with well defined characters.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good though it is, I don't think the future will be anything like this. I should really put my money where my mouth is and write a story myself.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the only way that's going to happen is if somebody kidnaps me and doesn't let me out until I've written a book.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="book-review"></category></entry><entry><title>Loft Insulation</title><link href="/loft-insulation.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-02-23T20:26:00+00:00</published><updated>2010-02-23T20:26:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-02-23:/loft-insulation.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My house was built with a room in the loft.

&lt;p&gt;I've got to go swimming now, but I'll tell you all about it when I get back.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought a lot about colour, which colours go together. Eighties colours!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1986 I started at Dauntsey's School, and we lived in Littleton Panel. A few doors down was a graphic designer who had parties at the bottom of the garden where they cooked large amounts of rice, and played reggae music.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember talking to the son of one of our neighbours, he was probably about 20 years old, and he was into surfing. He talked about how cool it was to shoot seagulls with an air gun. He considered me a square and remonstrated that when he was my age he was getting drunk and going to nightclubs, and why wasn't I? I was silent, but there didn't seem the opportunity to do such things, and they didn't seem very appealing anyway. So yes, I was a square.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Round the side of that house was where I spray-painted one of my CDT projects. It was my best subject, CDT. This particular project was a device for picking things up, so that you didn't have to stoop. Everyone had the same problem to solve. Mine was a black plastic tube that opened two-thirds of the way down, operated by a hidden metal rod that was pushed with one's thumb. The idea was that it looked like an anonymous black tube.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another CDT project was a desk-lamp. Mine was an anonymous grey prism. In fact, it seems that all my designs were based on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solid"&gt;platonic solids&lt;/a&gt;. My CDT teacher was the best teacher. I always regret one time when he made a mistake, and I said, 'you screwed up sir'. I expected a brisk rebuke, but he just looked slightly hurt. I felt guilty, and a bit confused that I had the power to upset a teacher. I grew up a bit then.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my school days were nothing like The Breakfast Club, but it does have the power to take me back.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="film-review"></category></entry><entry><title>Hague's Double Standards</title><link href="/hagues-double-standards.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-02-20T07:53:00+00:00</published><updated>2010-02-20T07:53:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-02-20:/hagues-double-standards.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I listened to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Hague"&gt;William Hague&lt;/a&gt; on the Today programme yesterday, being questioned by John Humphries on the alleged extra-judicial killing by Israel of the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/feb/19/britain-denies-knowledge-hamas-leader"&gt;Hamas official in Dubai&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;I like mowing the grass, reading and computer programming. OMG, this is sounding bad! I rent the rooms in my house out to quirky lodgers. I call them quirky, but you should hear what they say about me.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like spending time in the pub with my friends.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've got two little nephews who are just fantastic!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cycle everywhere. In fact I've just sold my car because of climate change.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Dad's great, he's good company for going on a walk or something, and he always helps me out with DIY.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was brought up a Christian, but after a few years of intense doubt in my late teens I started to describe myself as an atheist.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politically I was brought up a socialist, but in my early teens I began to think for myself about politics. I began to be in favour of free markets and I put the emphasis on maximising the freedom of the individual.&lt;/p&gt;

A film I'd happily watch again. I always ask what the message or subtext of a film is. I've come to the conclusion that Dogville could only be made about a time and place where the police are corrupt, rather than forming part of an impartial leviathan. In that sense it joins the great majority of films that rely on a Hobbesian 'state of nature'.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/10/Dogville_poster.jpg/200px-Dogville_poster.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Dogville Poster" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/10/Dogville_poster.jpg/200px-Dogville_poster.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Grace's father says she is arrogant because she doesn't retaliate when people wrong her, rather she rationalizes their behaviour by saying that they're a victim of their environment. He calls this arrogance because it implies that she is morally superior because she can choose to do the right thing, but they cannot. Her father thinks that everyone is equally capable of making moral choices, so when they do, they should face the consequences.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone crosses Grace's father, he doesn't excuse them, he shoots them. In the end, Grace performs a volte face, and does the same.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This 'law of the jungle' is only right if you're in the jungle. A better arrangement is to have a Hobbesian leviathan to dispense justice. Then everyone is better off.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only problem is that films about people dutifully following the correct bureaucratic procedures to ensure the due process of law are boring.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's more I want to say, but I don't like to go on, so here it is in bullet points:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The film is too long. If it were published under a &lt;a href="http://www.creativecommons.org.uk/"&gt;CC&lt;/a&gt; license I'd shorten it by about an hour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn't really before, but now I like Nicole Kidman.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each resident of Dogville abused Grace. Was Tom the worst because he engineered the whole thing to provide material for his writing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The unusual staging of the film worked brilliantly. The only off-note was the miming of the opening and closing of doors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm sure anyone can make up some aphorisms. How hard can it be? What do you think of this:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A law is a good law if even those that break it, agree with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profound eh? Let's test it. The law against burglary is a good law. If one were to ask a burglar if it's right that burglary is illegal, she'd probably say yes. The law against taking drugs is a bad law. If one were to ask a dope fiend if it's right that drugs are prohibited, she'd probably say no.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for these two tests, the aphorism works!

Everyone had a view beforehand on whether the 3D was a good idea. Kazim had seen it in 2D and said 3D was a gimmick. Jamie had seen it in 3 and 2D and said the 2D was better.

&lt;a href="http://www.avatarmovie.com/images/wallpaper_07_800x600.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Avatar" src="http://www.avatarmovie.com/images/wallpaper_07_800x600.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I always tend to see political analogies in films, and to me Avatar was a damning criticism of the USA's presence in Iraq and Afghanistan. Through art, can the US see its actions in a different light? Can art make people better? The standard rebuttal is the Nazis, who had a subtle appreciation of art.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nietzsche devotes a whole section of &lt;em&gt;Human, All Too Human&lt;/em&gt; to a discussion of art. His view is that we are right to admire great works of art, but the conditions of religious feeling that generated them no longer obtain. Art then to Nietzsche has an elegaic quality, to appreciate but not repeat.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nietzsche is wrong. Art, like maths, can't be put in a box.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="film-review"></category></entry><entry><title>Knowing</title><link href="/knowing.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-01-03T14:48:00+00:00</published><updated>2010-01-03T14:48:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2010-01-03:/knowing.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Kazim was over for the weekend, and on Saturday we went on a walk to &lt;a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=51.42823&amp;amp;lon=-1.85406&amp;amp;zoom=16&amp;amp;layers=B000FTF"&gt;Avebury&lt;/a&gt; with my brother and my dad.

&lt;p&gt;Exciting all the way through, with a twist at the end. A lot of biblical themes and imagery. Adam and Eve at the end for example. The Rapture came to mind. It's well known in America, for example in Paramore's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignorance_%28song%29"&gt;Ignorance&lt;/a&gt; Hayley Williams sings:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not a war no, it's not a rapture&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rapture is not so well known outside the USA though.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film makers reconcile their religious beliefs with modern science, by giving the role of God to aliens. I'm exasperated by this attitude. We've got to take responsibility ourselves. Jesus won't save us, and neither will aliens.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember standing by the cooker and saying something slightly blasphemous. My mum was concerned that I'd receive divine retribution. I replied that if God did strike me down, as least we'd know he actually existed, and mankind would have learned something useful.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being an atheist, I still feel very uncomfortable blaspheming, it's the result of a religious upbringing. As Nietzsche says:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is Dead; but given the way of men, there may still be caves for thousands of years in which his shadow will be shown. And we — we still have to vanquish his shadow, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think I've vanquished his shadow. If things are going well for me, I still feel that God will punish me for my hubris.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="film-review"></category></entry><entry><title>The World Of Zero Privacy</title><link href="/world-of-zero-privacy.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-12-30T10:58:00+00:00</published><updated>2009-12-30T10:58:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2009-12-30:/world-of-zero-privacy.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maude:&lt;/em&gt; What if &lt;a href="http://gawker.com/5419271/google-ceo-secrets-are-for-filthy-people"&gt;Schmidt was right&lt;/a&gt;?

Anyway, back to the book. People who know about these things would say that it's post-modern. It refers to itself, the author appears, all sorts of things. Tristram Shandy I thought.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must say that I can't stand stories that play these clever tricks. Vonnegut gets away with it this time because it's so brilliantly done, and because the subject suits it. Usually though, you can't beat a proper story. Just like Iain Banks writes.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, I find it liberating that one can write successfully in a variety of ways. Nietzsche wrote a book entirely of aphorisms. I hope that the important thing is having something to say, and the form can look after itself.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="book-review"></category></entry><entry><title>Noaty Thing</title><link href="/noaty-thing.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-12-06T17:15:00+00:00</published><updated>2009-12-06T17:15:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2009-12-06:/noaty-thing.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My brother and I used to play Monopoly continually as children.

Anticipating the banking crisis by several decades, we would borrow huge sums from the bank to spend on sub-prime mortgages. The sums were so large that we used the spare title deed card as a promissory note for a gigantic amount of money. (Incidentally, this is how we learnt from my dad what a million was.)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our mum didn't like us engaging in this large scale lending because it made the game too harrowing. So we hid money and the promissory note under the board. That's why you can see in the top right hand corner it says, 'noaty thing'. It could mean 'naughty thing'. I think it means 'noughty thing', meaning 'thing with a lot of noughts'.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Martin Amis's Money</title><link href="/martin-amiss-money.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-12-06T16:48:00+00:00</published><updated>2009-12-06T16:48:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2009-12-06:/martin-amiss-money.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b9/MoneyNovel.jpg/180px-MoneyNovel.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Money Cover" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b9/MoneyNovel.jpg/180px-MoneyNovel.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

My cousin is training to be a hairdresser and I went along to the salon where he's working and he gave me a new hair style for practice. John Self, the protagonist of Martin Amis's Money called it 'having a rug-rethink'. Self is the ultimate consumer. At the time it was written, nobody used the word 'sustainable' like they do now. Self's life is [unsustainable]{style="font-style: italic;"}. Not just environmentally though, his life simply cannot carry on in the same manner for long. All the time you're reading it you just know it's all going to come crashing down.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Money&lt;/em&gt; is one of those books that's always appearing in the top 100 of this and that. Jim, a temp at work, said it's one of his favourite books. I noticed it on the shelf at my aunt's boyfriend's house. It just kept [appearing]{style="font-style: italic;"}.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is incredibly well written. It's just bang on with its [rug]{style="font-style: italic;"}s and [sock]{style="font-style: italic;"}s. Brilliantly clever; the writing is just in a different league to most books. Very funny as well as clever. At one point Self is explaining how someone has a quick temper. He says, 'for him, [every]{style="font-style: italic;"} straw's the last straw. The [first]{style="font-style: italic;"} straw is the last straw.'  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amis makes highly effective use of italics. In homage I've used [lots]{style="font-style: italic;"} of italics in this post.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="book-review"></category></entry><entry><title>Smile came good after all!</title><link href="/smile-came-good-after-all.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-12-06T16:40:00+00:00</published><updated>2009-12-06T16:40:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2009-12-06:/smile-came-good-after-all.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.smile.co.uk/icons/smile/favicon.ico"&gt;&lt;img alt="Smile Icon" src="http://www.smile.co.uk/icons/smile/favicon.ico"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Actually the &lt;a href="/haywire-smile.html"&gt;haywire Smile episode&lt;/a&gt; wasn't as bad as I made out.

Rather than thinking, 'I must remember this if I ever end up in prison', it made me even more determined to avoid prison. I quite liked the subtitles, as it made it easier to work out what was going on. Convincing prison atmosphere is often at odds with clear diction. The final scene stayed with me. You know, the bit where the cars come round the corner one after the other. Cleverly done.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Serious Man was the most mainstream of the films I saw at the festival. It does a fine job of evoking a particular world. I'm not a sophisticated film-goer, so the thing that interested me most was the serious man's brother. Particularly his 'mentaculus', a book to do with probabilities. It helped him win at cards, but it turned out that what he was doing was illegal. I wanted the mentaculus and the brother to save the day and everything would end happily. Okay, that would have destroyed the artistic integrity of the piece, but...  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me the best film by far that I saw at the festival was &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sky_Crawlers_%28film%29"&gt;The Sky Crawlers&lt;/a&gt;. The first thing is that the music was outstanding. It seemed to capture the mood of the film perfectly. The emotional tone of the story, animation and music were all in concert. Crawlers showed the best of what a film can be. I was transported to a different world. The animation was in its rightful place as part of the film, rather than the film being a vehicle for the animation. Really, the film was driven by the story, which is the right way round. I find that few films deserve a second viewing. This one would. The best film I've seen this year.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="film-review"></category></entry><entry><title>A Right Twister</title><link href="/right-twister.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-12-03T17:22:00+00:00</published><updated>2009-12-03T17:22:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2009-12-03:/right-twister.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Doing maths is exciting, maths textbooks are boring, reading about the exploits of mathematicians is interesting.

I noticed a man sitting at the bottom of the steps leading from the front of a house to the pavement. At first I assumed he'd just a had a bit too much to drink. About two steps past him I realized something was wrong.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went back, bent down and asked if he was okay. As if in response he keeled over to his left. His shoulder hit the pavement, followed by a muffled thud as his head struck the pavement too. I got my phone out to call an ambulance.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried talking to him, and he responded by swearing at me in a slow, slurred voice. When the ambulance arrived I told the medic what I knew, and left.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in shock for the rest of the day, still am a bit.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This episode had me tutting and snorting at the TV. The idea was that a gas processing plant had blown up and the nation had a week before the lights went out. The only way to save us was to do a deal with an unpleasant regime and turn a blind eye to them murdering a UK citizen.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If something like that happened, the government shouldn't get involved. Gas prices would rise, which would mean electricity prices would rise. People would use less gas and electricity as a result and a new equilibrium would be found. Other sources of energy would make a healthy profit, directing future investment towards them.  &lt;/p&gt;

The first thing you need to know is that the 'Ayn' in

Asperger's. I say hero rather than protagonist because the characters
&lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; heroic. Rand believes that humans &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be heroic. Her morality casts a
person as a trader. One should always act in one's own self-interest. A trade
should not take place unless both sides gain. Charity and selflessness are
dirty words to Rand. The Marxist slogan,
'&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_each_according_to_his_ability,_to_each_according_to_his_need"&gt;from each according to their ability&lt;/a&gt;,
to each according to their need', is anathema to Rand. She appeals to the
evolutionary vigilance against freeloaders.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.edge.org/q2004/page5.html#dawkins"&gt;Dawkins' Law of Adversarial Debate&lt;/a&gt; says that when two incompatible beliefs are advocated with equal intensity, the truth does not lie half way between them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in disagreement with Dawkins, Marx and Rand, I think people that create wealth should be allowed to keep most of it, but some should be taken from them to give minimal support to the whole population. A good start would be to &lt;a href="http://www.polifesto.com/policies/16/"&gt;stop taxing the poor&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/84/AtlasShrugged.jpg/200px-AtlasShrugged.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Atlas Shrugged" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/84/AtlasShrugged.jpg/200px-AtlasShrugged.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Patents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On patents she has the baddies say that they want to end the monopoly that Reardon had on Reardon Metal. I agreed with the baddies on this!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But later on in Galt's prolix radio address he says, 'it is only the value of an idea that can be shared with unlimited numbers of men, making all sharers richer at no one's sacrifice or loss'. Hear, hear!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Rand seems to be ambivalent on patents.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that same address, Galt says that you can't be responsible for something you have no control over, and in this way convincingly demolishes the idea of original sin.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At times I found Rand's arguments embarrassingly one-dimensional, a real sixth form-ish style of argument, often falling into the straw man fallacy. However, Atlas is a polemic and so I forgive it for overstating its case.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another beef I have with Rand is that she mainly avoids democracy. When she doesn't avoid it she's denigrating it. Come on Rand, democracy is a good thing, there's no getting away from it. Plato's philosopher kings? Gimme a break.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By instinct I'm a right wing libertarian, and so I have an innate sympathy for Rand's ideas. This book was really on my wavelength, we think alike. I 'got' what she was trying to say. On the other hand, this view has shortcomings which I can't and won't overlook.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that comes to mind is that Reynolds uses the word 'caul' too much.&lt;br&gt;
Revelation Space is a space opera of vast scope, Prefect is more character driven. I prefer Prefect. I think I can detect Iain M. Banks' influence on a lot of sci-fi. Did he set up the Jeeves and Wooster relationship between AIs and humans? Also the ironic naming of ships.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reynolds is to be applauded for giving some of his human characters technological modifications. We haven't gone far enough though. It's not going to be too much longer before humans will have changed beyond recognition. How this issue pans out in the future depends on the nature of consciousness. Perhaps consciousness can merge and separate? Perhaps it can't. Maybe there's a limit to the size of a conscious entity, maybe not. I think someone needs to make some guesses here and then see how it plays out in a story. I'd love to write a sci-fi story. The problem is that it would never be as good as Reynolds...&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="book-review"></category></entry><entry><title>Free The Postcode</title><link href="/free-postcode.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-11-01T17:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2009-11-01T17:30:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2009-11-01:/free-postcode.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.freethepostcode.org/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Free The Postcode" src="http://www.freethepostcode.org/rmail.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been doing a bit of mapping on OpenStreetmap, and I'll post the results once they're visible. Tomorrow I'll take a few more GPS traces before catching my train at about 15:00. Once last lunch in Amboise I think.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Segueing neatly from Signs the film, to a sign for a public footpath. This sign means that to follow the blue path, if you're coming from the right stop, and turn right. These signs can be painted on trees, painted on the road, or embedded in dirt tracks. You go from sign to sign, like following spoor when hunting an animal.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grape picking is mechnised these days. The owner of my gite isn't a fan. She says that wine from hand picked grapes is superior.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The grape picking machine on the left is pouring the grapes into a truck.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You'll say that I've been watching too many sci-fi films, but this could be a scene on an alien planet, like the spice harvesters in Dune. The peasants following the machine, tending it like an elephant. Of course they're not really peasants, probably multi-millionare owners of a wine empire. I said bonjour to them, and they replied cheerfully. I've no idea what they said, I learnt French by reading Emile Zola.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going for a jog now. Since I can't understand the signs, I just jog down any old track. I'm sure some of the signs say 'Keep Out', 'Strictly Private', 'Biohazard' etc. Some have pictures of slavering guard dogs, and I've no idea what [they]{style="font-style: italic;"} indicate.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>At Claire's Birthday</title><link href="/at-claires-birthday.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-10-04T13:58:00+01:00</published><updated>2009-10-04T13:58:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2009-10-04:/at-claires-birthday.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Laces" src="/images/2009/2009-09-19_20_06_55.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a passable haddock risotto at the &lt;a href="http://www.watershed.co.uk/"&gt;Watershed&lt;/a&gt; restaurant yesterday. We proceeded thence to Screen 2 at the Watershed to see Afterschool.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some films convey their truth by smoothly omitting the everyday details of life, and some by showing 'warts and all'. Afterschool takes the latter approach. Soon into the film one is immersed in Robert's world of an American boarding school. As he tries to make sense of the world, one is also forced along with him to divine the motives and intentions of the various characters in his world.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Youtube is the lens through which Robert lives his life. When confronted by a real life event, he responds as though it were just another clip on Youtube. When Robert is alone with a girl, he falls back on his Youtube mentoring, and behaves inappropriately.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a difficult film to watch, in the sense that moral ambiguity abounds. Things are much easier if there are goodies and baddies, but then if things are clear-cut one feels shortchanged. This is nearly one of those films that bear a second viewing.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="film-review"></category></entry><entry><title>Formal Methods</title><link href="/formal-methods.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-08-18T22:34:00+01:00</published><updated>2009-08-18T22:34:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2009-08-18:/formal-methods.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don't understand &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods"&gt;formal methods&lt;/a&gt;.

Then it must have been demonstrated that the C code exactly matched the proof.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if it's easier to write the specification than the code, that must mean that the programming language isn't very good. And yes! This is borne out by the sort of &lt;a href="http://ertos.nicta.com.au/research/l4.verified/proof.pml"&gt;programming errors that are found&lt;/a&gt; when comparing the specification to the implementation:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buffer overflows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Null pointer dereferences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pointer errors in general&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory leaks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arithmetic overflows and exceptions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are mostly solved by using a decent programming language such as Python.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you put a book on the edge of a table you can balance it so that it sticks out half a book length. Place another judiciously on top and it'll stick out 1/2 + 1/3 book lengths. You give the function above a number of book lengths you want the stack to stick out, and it'll return the number of books you need.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming from a Python background, wouldn't it make sense to use whitespace instead of parentheses?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;defn num_books
[dist]
num_books dist 0 0
[dist achieved nbooks]
if
   &amp;gt;= achieved dist
   nbooks
   num_books dist
       + achieved
           / 1
               + nbooks 2
       + nbooks 1

println
num_books desired_distance
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Also, I'm interested to compare this function with its Python equivalent:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;def num_books(desired):
achieved = 0
nbooks = 0
while achieved &amp;lt; desired:
 achieved = achieved + 1 / (nbooks + 2)
 nbooks = nbooks + 1
return nbooks
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Python one is shorter, how can this be? Okay a re-write of the Lisp version:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;(defn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;num_books&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;dist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;(loop&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;nbooks&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;achieved&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class="nv"&gt;(if&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="nv"&gt;(&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;achieved&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;dist)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nv"&gt;(recur&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nv"&gt;(inc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;nbooks)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="nv"&gt;(+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;achieved&lt;/span&gt;

Here's a painting of E.M.Forster. Note that his head is pointy at the back. This is believed to be source of his literary powers.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in a cafe and someone there recommended Forster, so I got Where Angels Fear To Tread from the library. It was his first novel, written when he was 26. I think this shows, in that he is careful to demonstrate his cleverness. He also deliberately uses terse, modern language, wanting to be fresh and free of pomposity. The economy of expression is a sign that he is afraid of losing the reader's attention. More experienced writers are less constrained and are a bit more expansive. For instance, in The Brothers Karamazov, Dostoevsky uses seemingly redundant verbiage with abandon, yet his genius is that this has meaning in itself, and so is not wasted.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you Forster, this is a very thoughtful book.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="book-review"></category></entry><entry><title>I'm impressed you're going to try out Ubun...</title><link href="/post-4911088423124909056.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-08-04T19:57:00+01:00</published><updated>2009-08-04T19:57:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2009-08-04:/post-4911088423124909056.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm impressed you're going to try out Ubuntu!

Here's a note to Glyn on why I think he's wrong on this occasion:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You conflate single sign-on (SSO) and single identity. OpenId lets you have SSO [and]{style="font-style: italic;"}lets you have a separate identity for each web site you visit. It's called Directed Identity, and Peter Williams &lt;a href="http://barelyenough.org/blog/2007/12/openid-20s-killer-feature/"&gt;gives a good explanation&lt;/a&gt; of it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://openid.net/logo-graphics/openid-icon-250x250.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="OpenId" src="http://openid.net/logo-graphics/openid-icon-250x250.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~~Yahoo! implement directed identity. Anyone with a Yahoo! account that signs in to websites using OpenId automatically has a different ID for each web site. When you sign in to the web site you just type yahoo.com in the OpenId box, and Yahoo! magically works it all out.~~  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;ins&gt;I got that last paragraph wrong. As &lt;a href="http://willnorris.com/2009/07/openid-directed-identity-identifier-select"&gt;Will Norris explains&lt;/a&gt;, Yahoo! implements &lt;em&gt;identifier select&lt;/em&gt; and can give an &lt;em&gt;opaque URL&lt;/em&gt;, Yahoo! does not support &lt;em&gt;directed identity&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;There were flaws though. I had a sense that the plot was a shade unrealistic, or worse, fell short on integrity. For example, it wasn't clear exactly what was happening with the communications to Earth. It's probably that I didn't understand it properly!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As ever with this type of story, the robot is the most interesting character. I think this is because it forces the viewer to think about what it means to be human.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="film-review"></category></entry><entry><title>Back Seat Driver</title><link href="/back-seat-driver.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-07-29T11:18:00+01:00</published><updated>2009-07-29T11:18:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2009-07-29:/back-seat-driver.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f9/BMW_Logo.svg/160px-BMW_Logo.svg.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="BMW" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f9/BMW_Logo.svg/160px-BMW_Logo.svg.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

It's astonishing in The Brothers Karamazov (published in 1880) how up-to-date Dotoevsky is with scientific ideas. To whit:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ivan's demon visitor talks of the 10 minutes it takes for light to travel from the sun to the earth.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;In the same conversation, he talks of the low temperature of space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ivan mentions non-euclidean geometry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While in custody awaiting trial, Dimitri talks of mind being the product of the activity of nerve cells in the brain, not a soul.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=&amp;amp;ands=karamazov&amp;amp;phrase=&amp;amp;ors=&amp;amp;nots=&amp;amp;tag=&amp;amp;lang=all&amp;amp;from=t_locke&amp;amp;to=&amp;amp;ref=&amp;amp;near=&amp;amp;within=15&amp;amp;units=mi&amp;amp;since=&amp;amp;until=&amp;amp;rpp=50"&gt;tweeted my impressions&lt;/a&gt; as I read the book. I knew Dostoevsky was an epileptic, but I wondered if he was a schizophrenic as well. The 'brain fever' that Ivan suffers is described so vividly he must have had some first hand experience of it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[[In Chapter 6, the pivotal dialogue between Ivan Fyodorovich and Smerdyakov is brilliant. For me, it is one of the great dialogues, up there with Jesus and Pilate in The Master And Margarita.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like how Dostoevsky zooms in and explains the mundane details of how a great event comes about. It reminds me of Daniel Dennet's discussions of free will.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Life Of The Elder Zosima, there's a captivating story of the guilt of a 'mysterious visitor'. In fact I think the overriding theme of Dostoevsky's work is guilt. I feel guilt pretty heavily, and maybe that's why I'm attracted to these books.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, another great skill of Dostoevsky is to have high drama and passion, without it being farcical. I did find myself laughing at times though, wondering to myself if his characters were 'emotionally incontinent'.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kolya Krasotkin: the most insufferably precocious child in all literature? Okay, only when we first meet him. Alyosha does have a moderating effect thereafter.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end I shed a few tears. Well, I did.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The first use of the Human-Machine is as an 'erotic dancer', setting the pattern we've seen ever since of porn and hi-tech advancing together, intertwined, into the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a silent film, with text giving a narrative. I like this, films should revert to written descriptions of what's going on. It would help me to understand what was going on.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film is divided up into sections like an opera. We start off with a prelude, then there's an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermezzo#Opera_intermezzo"&gt;intermezzo&lt;/a&gt;. I like that too. After the prelude I paused the DVD and fetched chocolate / coffee bean &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag%C3%A9e#Chocolate"&gt;dragées&lt;/a&gt; to eat during the intermezzo. I recommend you do too.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main idea of the film is that 'the heart must be the mediator between the head and the hands' in the body politic. I take this to mean that capitalism creates wealth most quickly, but it's not distributed fairly. A compromise is to have capitalism, but tax income to fund a citizen's allowance so that everyone can benefit from the wealth that capitalism creates. If it does mean this, then I heartily agree!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="film-review"></category></entry><entry><title>Bristol Museum vs Banksy</title><link href="/blog-post.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-07-12T20:04:00+01:00</published><updated>2009-07-12T20:04:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2009-07-12:/blog-post.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/t_locke/status/2598743463"&gt;Queuing to get in.&lt;/a&gt; It takes about an hour.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When waiting for a train, spread out evenly along the platform.&lt;/strong&gt; I always see everyone trying to board the train through the same door, forming a massive queue. If all the entrances to the train were used evenly, the train could actually leave on time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wait for people to get off before getting on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While you're waiting for people to get off, queue parallel to the train and for heaven's sake leave a generous gap to let people get off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you get on the train, walk along to the middle of the carriage &lt;strong&gt;AND DON'T DAWDLE&lt;/strong&gt; then find a seat. If there isn't a seat, then stand as near to the middle of the carriage as you can.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've

may remember an &lt;a href="/limits-of-free-speech.html"&gt;earlier post&lt;/a&gt; on the
limits of freedom of speech where I quoted Noam Chomsky:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In brief, speech should be protected up to participation in imminent criminal action. So if you and I go into a store to rob it, and I say "shoot," that's not protected.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The poster says, 'Everybody's talking about it!' and people do still talk of it, so I thought I should see what it was all about. So Kazim and Liz came over and we watched Citizen Kane.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, the film is a morality tale. Its essence is revealed when Kane's second wife leaves him, and he pleads with her not to, saying how much it will hurt him. She retorts that he only only thinks of the hurt she may cause him, and doesn't think of the hurt he's causing her, and that's why she's leaving.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's saying, 'if you're a selfish control-freak who is only concerned with outward signs of success, then you'll end up friendless and alone'.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="film-review"></category></entry><entry><title>imprimatur-015</title><link href="/imprimatur-015.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-05-13T01:13:00+01:00</published><updated>2009-05-13T01:13:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2009-05-13:/imprimatur-015.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=145016&amp;amp;package_id=159509"&gt;New release&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://imprimatur.wikispaces.com/"&gt;Imprimatur&lt;/a&gt; with the following changes:  &lt;/p&gt;

I've visited the &lt;a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/elections2009/default.htm?language=en"&gt;EU's election website&lt;/a&gt; (filled with dull and worthy headlines such as 'From One Legislative Period To The Next') seeking a list of the candidates standing in my area, and what their manifestos are.

Ah, found a &lt;a href="http://www.europarl.org.uk/sites/all/modules/tinymce/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/filemanager/files/elections/candidates/SouthWest_candidates.pdf"&gt;list of candidates&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="http://www.europarl.org.uk/"&gt;UK office of the European Parliament&lt;/a&gt;. Well I'll ignore the Christian Party "Proclaiming Christ's Lordship", Fair Pay Fair Trade Party and the like and concentrate on the ones I've heard of. It's a bit unfair, but I haven't got all day. I have to choose a single party, and then the seats get allocated according to &lt;a href="http://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk/how_do_i_vote/voting_systems/european_parliament_elections.aspx"&gt;an unusual system&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Green Party&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've had a look at their &lt;a href="http://southwest.greenparty.org.uk/region/southwest/people.html"&gt;list of candidates&lt;/a&gt;, and their &lt;a href="http://southwest.greenparty.org.uk/region/southwest/policy/core_policies.html"&gt;core policies&lt;/a&gt;. The first policy is:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resist economic globalisation and privatisation. Revive UK manufacturing for a balanced economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well they can stop right there. I'm not against economic globalisation or privatisation. Also I wouldn't intervene to help one sector of the economy against another. Maybe I'm being a bit hasty, let's look further down the list:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No single currency. No further centralisation of economic or political power. No EU army.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why rule out the single currency? For the UK to have its own currency is bonkers. I'd like to see an EU army as well, and an EU government! No way am I voting green.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Liberal Democrats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.grahamwatsonmep.org/"&gt;Graham Watson&lt;/a&gt; is the first candidate. I'm glad he's &lt;a href="http://www.grahamwatsonmep.org/news/000596/eu_needs_a_green_energy_super_grid.html"&gt;supporting the European Grid&lt;/a&gt;. Not a word about EU elections on the &lt;a href="http://www.libdems.org.uk/"&gt;LibDems UK site&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="http://www.alde.eu/"&gt;ALDE group&lt;/a&gt; in the european parliament has a list of its &lt;a href="http://www.alde.eu/fileadmin/webdocs/key_docs/10Priorities-booklet-EN.pdf"&gt;top ten policies&lt;/a&gt;. Ooh, don't like talk of the 'european social model'. Like the bit about common foreign policy. Point 9 seems to point to tentative support of free trade? The entire list is vague and woolly, but nothing too appalling.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Labour&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their &lt;a href="http://www.eurolabour.org.uk/Issues"&gt;list of issues&lt;/a&gt; highlights the importance of the European Social Chapter, something I'm sceptical about. Their &lt;a href="http://www.eurolabour.org.uk/Health"&gt;health text&lt;/a&gt; is good:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From food additives, to dangerous chemicals at work and to free emergency hospital treatment throughout the EU, acting at European level makes a real difference for your health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose that's where socialism comes into its own.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly there, thanks for bearing with me this far...  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conservatives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tories are members of the &lt;a href="http://www.epp-ed.org/europeandemocrats/"&gt;European Democrats&lt;/a&gt;. They say:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ED is expressly committed to democracy, individual liberty, the rule of law, national sovereignty, free enterprise, minimal regulation, low taxation, private ownership, respect and security for every individual and a strong transatlantic alliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well that's great, just the party for me! But what about this national sovereignty? I think that's sometimes in conflict with individual liberty. I can live and work anywhere within the EU, and that's a triumph for individual liberty. But it was only possible at the cost of national sovereignty. So sorry ED, until you rid yourself of this 'national sovereignty' hangup, I'll not vote for you.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Liberal Democrats have my vote at EU elections on 4th June.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>June 4th 2009: Council elections</title><link href="/june-4th-2009-council-elections.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-05-10T19:02:00+01:00</published><updated>2009-05-10T19:02:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2009-05-10:/june-4th-2009-council-elections.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;On the 4th of June, I've got the Wiltshire Council elections.  &lt;/p&gt;

Education, fairly standard nothing to frighten the horses. Funding decided by local democracy. Environment: okay, but would rather hear talk of free trade than fair trade. They have a 'leisure' section. I hate this use of the word leisure.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chris March&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conservatives' don't seem to have a manifesto for the Wiltshire council elections. There is a &lt;a href="http://www.wiltshireconservatives.com/index.php?sectionid=100&amp;amp;pagenumber=128"&gt;page on Chris March&lt;/a&gt;, but it contains no details of what he intends to do.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason I had to travel to another city, and I was driven there at high speed along a dual-carriageway in a go-cart by Jonathan. I remember thinking that we were going to crash and die, and kept telling Jonathan to slow down. We made it in the end.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I was house-sitting and a middle-aged woman came to inspect the house. I was eating something like liquorice root, and couldn't talk properly so I spat it out in the garden. It looked like dog poo, and I hoped she wouldn't notice it when she inspected the garden.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="dream"></category></entry><entry><title>Open Streetmap</title><link href="/open-streetmap.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-05-07T23:09:00+01:00</published><updated>2009-05-07T23:09:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2009-05-07:/open-streetmap.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=51.31207&amp;amp;lon=-2.2157&amp;amp;zoom=17&amp;amp;layers=0B00FTF"&gt;&lt;img alt="Map" src="http://b.tah.openstreetmap.org/Tiles/tile/17/64729/43698.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I uploaded the trace to OSM, did some editing and now it's there, really simple. I've learnt that you have to do traces longer than about 100m, otherwise the whole process doesn't seem to work very well.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People wonder why I contribute to OSM. They shake their heads in disbelief that I'd do this work without getting paid. I think the key thing is that when you contribute to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_culture_movement"&gt;non-proprietary information&lt;/a&gt;, society as a whole benefits, and so I do too (being a part of society).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is in contrast to, say, working in a shop for nothing. Working in a shop without pay would benefit the shop owner, but not necessarily society as a whole, and would not necessarily benefit me.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>blogging from phone</title><link href="/blogging-from-phone.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-05-06T08:37:00+01:00</published><updated>2009-05-06T08:37:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2009-05-06:/blogging-from-phone.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well I've got my Android phone, and it's not for the prolix!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well I've got my Android phone, and it's not for the prolix!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>River Cottage Canteen</title><link href="/river-cottage-canteen.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-05-01T20:27:00+01:00</published><updated>2009-05-01T20:27:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2009-05-01:/river-cottage-canteen.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.rivercottage.net/Images/Uploads/Banners/bath_banner.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="River Cottage" src="http://www.rivercottage.net/Images/Uploads/Banners/bath_banner.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several books that I've had to stop reading due to psychological disquiet, one of them was a Philip K Dick. High Castle had that quality, though to a lesser degree. It's clever, engaging and mildly disturbing. It was a bit too enigmatic for my taste, I like to have everything laid out clearly. I'm not brainy enough to grasp the full meaning of the book. Interestingly, in this book there's a discussion about what an author is trying to say in a book. All very post-modern I'm sure.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="book-review"></category></entry><entry><title>Play Ogg</title><link href="/play-ogg.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-04-27T20:25:00+01:00</published><updated>2009-04-27T20:25:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2009-04-27:/play-ogg.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://playogg.org/"&gt;&lt;img alt="Play Ogg" src="http://www.fsf.org/resources/formats/playogg/ogg_data/play_ogg_large"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Apparently the guy used to be a computer programmer, then turned his hand to sci-fi.

&lt;p&gt;There's an intelligent use of technology in this book. Singularities seem to crop up everywhere now. It seems that once a culture hits a singularity, they then disappear to some other dimension. Can someone explain a bit more about this? A similar thing happens in Banks' culture books. They sublime or something.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it's only a book, and I know people are often backed up, but I'm concerned at the casual violence. The violence is depicted, but then not really explored. It may not be fun to dwell on the consequences of violence, but when the protagonist despatches another soldier we don't see the months and years of grief felt by her family and friends.  &lt;/p&gt;

Drinking is part of the background of the story. A visitor arrives, and champagne is fetched from the fridge. In my world, champagne is for weddings and such. I do like the idea of having a bottle of champagne chilled and waiting for a random visitor.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backhand let me down as ever. Paddy's main tactic was to hit high and long to my backhand, then I'd do a lame return. If it actually made it over the net he'd just smash it. Then if I was in a position to return it with my forehand, he'd do a drop shot just over the net on the opposite side of the court to where I was. This is new. He's got pretty good at those drop shots now.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I travelled from Trowbridge to Bath Spa on my season ticket. At Bath there wasn't time to buy a ticket before the train departed for Swindon, so I hopped on, thinking I'd buy a ticket on the train or at Swindon.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Swindon I asked if I could buy a return from Bath to Swindon. The person said yes, and led me to the ticket office. The ticket office person refused, saying that I had illegally travelled without a ticked, and I'd have to pay for two singles rather than a return. I argued my case for about half an hour before capitulating. During this time all sorts of security people and supervisors were brought on the scene.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm doing it for selfish reasons; it'll help create a richer society for my enjoyment! For example, businesses will be able to provide services for me that they otherwise wouldn't be able to do.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reject the &lt;a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Libre_Society_Manifesto"&gt;libre manifesto&lt;/a&gt;; I'm not against capitalism, and in fact I think that libre knowledge is good for capitalism.

&lt;p&gt;1. Compel tax havens to abide by strict international rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are PPF's aims, together with my reasons for not joining:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Compel tax havens to abide by strict international rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agree.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Insist on fundamental governance reform of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could mean anything. I'm all for UN institutions being controlled by a democratically elected world government.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Make all financial institutions, financial products and multinationals transparent and publicly accountable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I'm not sure what they're saying.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Ensure a massive investment in a green new deal to build a green economy based on decent work and fair pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, no, no. Please no more public spending. The government needs to start getting out of debt, not getting deeper into debt.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Invest in and strengthen public provision of essential services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As above.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. Work to ensure sufficient emergency funding to all countries that need it, without damaging conditionalities attached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Conditionalities'? Don't they mean conditions? Anyway, we in the UK should be dismantling our protectionist policies, and promoting free trade.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. Deliver 0.7% of national income as aid by 2013, deliver aid more effectively and push for the cancellation of all illegitimate and unpayable developing country debts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aid shouldn't be normal, it's only useful in emergencies. It's our job in the UK to make sure we're not in the way of countries getting themselves out of poverty. That means getting rid of our subsidies (common agricultural policy etc.) and getting rid of import tariffs that limit imports from other countries.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also make sure that intellectual wealth is available, for example by abandoning software patents.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. Ensure that poorer states are allowed to take responsibility for managing their economies, including controlling cross-border capital flows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9. Stop pushing developing countries to liberalise and deregulate their economies, and do not attempt to rush through a completion of the Doha trade round, a deal that developing countries have rejected several times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well other countries can do what they like, but we in the UK and Europe should be adopting free trade policies.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10. In addition to the green new deal (recommendation 4), introduce the robust regulatory requirements and financial incentives needed to deliver a green economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the wrong way round. Government shouldn't pick winners, this should be done by the market. What government can do is increase the price of emitting greenhouse gases.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11. Push for a deal at Copenhagen to agree substantial, verifiable cuts in greenhouse gases, which will limit temperature increases to well below 2°C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agreed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12. Commit to substantial new resource transfer from North to South, additional to Overseas Development Assistance (ODA), to support adaptation and sustainable development in poor countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I think aid is so difficult to get right, I'd rather rely on trade.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>White people with blue eyes</title><link href="/white-people-with-blue-eyes.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-03-29T14:51:00+01:00</published><updated>2009-03-29T14:51:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2009-03-29:/white-people-with-blue-eyes.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm the target of a &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7967546.stm"&gt;racist comment by Lula da Silva&lt;/a&gt; on the banking crisis:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speaker is working at Bath Uni on the next generation of batteries, to be used for powering cars. He's a chemist that uses computer models to investigate the properties of materials.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's so sad that Michael Crichton has died. It's selfish, but I'd have loved to have heard his thoughts on global warming as time went on, and I've always enjoyed his books. State Of Fear seems to challenge the idea of global warming, and attacks the atmosphere in which it's hard (for reasons not to do with science) to voice an alternative view.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It made me think about what I believe about global warming. I've always taken the view that I'm not a climate scientist (or even a scientist come to that!) and so I can't make my own mind up. So I have to trust that the scientific method is proceeding as it should, and getting closer to the truth. So really I'm putting my trust in the scientific method. But who do you go to to find out what scientists think? Well that's really difficult in theory. In practice it's not a problem as time goes on, but on new questions it does seem to be a problem. For climate change I generally go by the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change"&gt;IPCC&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One other thing: an idea put forward in the book is that scientific funding should be 'blind'. That is, the people carrying out the research shouldn't know who is funding it. That way you eliminate bias, both conscious and unconscious. I like this idea, can someone implement this now please?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="book-review"></category></entry><entry><title>I tried the link, but the site seems to be down :-...</title><link href="/post-879039221419528013.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-03-15T23:41:00+00:00</published><updated>2009-03-15T23:41:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2009-03-15:/post-879039221419528013.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I tried the link, but the site seems to be down :-(&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I tried the link, but the site seems to be down :-(&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Hooverdam Ogg Vorbis</title><link href="/hooverdam-ogg-vorbis.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-03-15T18:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2009-03-15T18:30:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2009-03-15:/hooverdam-ogg-vorbis.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I wage an intermittent campaign to get people to use &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorbis"&gt;Ogg Vorbis&lt;/a&gt; rather than MP3 because MP3 is encumbered by patents.

That was some time ago, and I've now just finished Volume 1.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theory is pretty much as I thought it would be, but all of Smith's arguments are filled with historical detail that was entirely new to me.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I listen today to the news of workers striking in protest at the free labour market of the EU, it's clear that Smith's ideas haven't convinced everybody. They have convinced me however, and I'm sure that an EU with a free labour market would be much richer than one with monopolies on labour.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard Lord Mandelson trying to make the case for free markets to John Humphreys, and he failed to answer John's straightforward questions.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that although with free markets society as a whole gets richer, the wealth isn't distributed evenly. Adam Smith describes what happens when the supply of labourers exceeds demand; they starve to death.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why I'm in favour of not taxing the poor. And indeed I'm in favour of a universal 'citizen's allowance', so that nobody goes hungry.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With free markets making society richer, and a citizen's allowance making sure nobody gets left behind, I think we can muddle through.  &lt;/p&gt;

The march in Bath targeted Starbucks, Marks &amp;amp; Spencer and Lloyds TSB.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I regard boycotts as a second-order activity, the primary action should be through the democratic institutions, particularly national governments and the UN. However, I wouldn't want my money going to support the Israeli occupation, so do the claims of the boycott advocates stack up?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Fisk writes of Howard Shultz (Chairman and CEO of Starbucks) in &lt;a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/starbucks-the-target-of-arab-boycott-for-its-growing-links-to-israel-749289.html"&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; in The Independent:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1998, Mr Shultz was awarded the "Israeli 50th Anniversary Tribute Award" from the Jerusalem Fund of Aish Ha-Torah, which is strongly critical of Yasser Arafat and insists that the occupied Palestinian territories should be described only as "disputed".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is enough to persuade me to get my occasional hot-chocolate from Cafe Nero rather than Starbucks. What about M&amp;amp;S and Lloyds? Well, I'm going to bed now, dear reader.

&lt;p&gt;Protesters walking past a resting busker.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Dave's Poster" src="/images/2009/_MG_4417.jpg"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me holding Dave Andrews' placard. This is one of the problems with reporting. You see I didn't actually understand Dave's placard, and so avoided carrying it. Caught on camera it seems like I'm endorsing the message.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="On Shoulders" src="/images/2009/_MG_4409.jpg"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of protesters came with their kids.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Holding Poster" src="/images/2009/_MG_4392.jpg"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The march was something of tour of central Bath, stopping off at shops that the organizers say support Israel. Does M&amp;amp;S really send money to Israel so that they can buy arms? Where am I going to buy my pants?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Protesters" src="/images/2009/_MG_4304.jpg"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think I can write a caption for this.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Onlookers" src="/images/2009/_MG_4380.jpg"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onlookers. Everyone was really friendly towards us. Many filmed us.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Protesters" src="/images/2009/_MG_4344.jpg"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great shot, as it places the action firmly in Bath.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Two Signs" src="/images/2009/_MG_4331.jpg"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russell's juxtaposition of signs. Incidentally, Russ was everywhere at once with his camera. I'd see him in the distance, perched on a litter bin, then turn round to see him at my elbow. A peace-loving ninja.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="War Poster" src="/images/2009/_MG_4215.jpg"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I was probably in a minority on the march in thinking that war &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; sometimes justified.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Free Palestine" src="/images/2009/_MG_4208.jpg"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this was outside one of the two Starbucks in Bath. We were told that money from Starbucks' customers goes to buy Israeli arms. Is that true? If I catch the Uni bus, I'll often pop in for a hot chocolate while I'm waiting. Not any more.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img alt="Posters" src="/images/2009/_MG_4193.jpg"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe this is outside Starbucks too.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Protesters" src="/images/2009/_MG_4150.jpg"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A supporter of the Israeli action walked through the protesters shouting, 'I support Israel! I support Israel!'. There was good-natured applause from the protesters, admiring her courage, if not her message.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Loud Hailer" src="/images/2009/_MG_4105.jpg"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leader of the march in full voice.

The plan was to then go back to my house to see a film. It was between Persepolis, Eyes Wide Shut and the English patient. I cut the Gordian Knot and grabbed Persepolis.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night at Liz's NYE party I was touched that Sarita said she was really pleased I'd made that choice as she probably wouldn't have seen it otherwise. It was an animated story about an Iranian girl growing up, focussing on the politics of the times. It made us feel lucky to have the freedoms we do in the UK, and more determined to defend them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking of NYE, Tom got in touch with me on Facebook out of the blue, and we met up and went to the various parties. Kazim's staying over as well.

&lt;p&gt;Fair enough, I do list it on my profile. I'm not great at badminton, but I love playing. I organize the badminton club at work, every week we play at Bath Uni. It's good for keeping fit because you concentrate so much on playing that you don't realize you're actually getting a lot of exercise.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shot I'd like to be able to play is a backhand from the back corner of the court that reaches right to the diagonally opposite corner, with the shuttlecock tracing out a high arc!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usually have at least one game of singles with Paddy. I always used to beat him, but then he asked what he should do to beat me. I foolishly told him to always hit it high to my backhand. He did that and beat me for the first time ever!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Israel, withdraw now!</title><link href="/israel-withdraw-now.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-12-30T15:57:00+00:00</published><updated>2008-12-30T15:57:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2008-12-30:/israel-withdraw-now.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm lying in bed with a temperature.

&lt;p&gt;Israel should end its occupation of Palastine, and withdraw to within its own borders. Israel should withdraw regardless of what the Palastinians are doing. The Israeli argument is that they are defending themselves against Hamas rocket attacks. But to the Palastinians it looks like Israel is the agressor.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Israel withdraws, and the rocket attacks still persist, then a UN force should be deployed in Palastine to surpress the rocket attacks. I doubt if the rocket attacks would continue, because there's only public support for Hamas because they are perceived as resisting the Israeli occupation.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Hi Chaz6!

&lt;p&gt;You'd update the DNS to stop your host name pointing to www.own-id.com.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment the deleting of the entry in Own-Id would be done manually by me. I could automate it if you like, but it hasn't been necessary up to now.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key thing is that an entry in Own-Id can only be deleted if the user's host name has stopped pointing to it. I've taken the approach that whoever controls the DNS for the host name, controls the entry in Own-Id.  &lt;/p&gt;

It's the work of a perfectionist. Every part of every scene is meticulously composed. I love the huge amount of thought that went into the film. It's the sort of thing one can watch repeatedly. Especially if, like me, you generally find plots hard to follow!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think my friends found it to be better than they thought they would.  &lt;/p&gt;

What gets me is that nearly all sci-fi is like it. Can't we have a vision of the future set in a stable, liberal democracy? I think that's the book I'm going to write.

&lt;p&gt;I don't want to sound too pessimistic. I learnt about the different approaches in proving that there are an infinite number of prime numbers. Chaitin also talks about Godel's incompleteness theorem implying that mathematical truth is partly something that is found by experiment. I liked his ideas about real numbers and digital philosophy.

&lt;p&gt;The gear change would work by changing to the smaller sprocket slightly before moving to the larger sprocket. This would mean that the chain would be slacker than usual for a moment, and then back to the normal tension.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this system you'd only be able to have about 3 or 4 gears in total.  &lt;/p&gt;

After the advent of zero cost copying (ZCC), the economy divides into two, the money economy and the information economy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For us I think ZCC occurred in the early 1990s. As I write, this is how the two economies are divided:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Information Economy]{style="font-weight: bold;"}  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encyclopaedia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dictionary  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scientific theories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Money Economy]{style="font-weight: bold;"}  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Food&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Energy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transport&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clothes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Land&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's discuss some of things in those two categories, and then talk about things I haven't mentioned that are in transition. I'll then make a stab at saying what'll happen in the future.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Software.]{style="font-weight: bold;"} It used to be that you'd buy software as if it were property. You'd buy it in a box, and the vendor would be paid for each box she sold. If it came pre-installed on a new computer, then it was still as though the software was a physical appendage. You weren't allowed to give someone else a copy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After ZCC everything changed for software. People started illegally copying software. Some of these were people who wouldn't dream of stealing anything physical and didn't think they were doing anything wrong, others were organized criminals. Into this chaos stepped &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft"&gt;copyleft&lt;/a&gt; software. Copyleft meant that copying wasn't illegal, in fact it was encouraged. This meant that the cost of copyleft software dropped to zero. Copyleft also allowed anyone to contribute and improve the software. Faced with this kind of competition, proprietory software went into a terminal decline. Thus software moved from Money to Information.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Encyclopaedia]{style="font-weight: bold;"}. It used to be that an encyclopaedia came as a book that you paid for, printed on dead trees. A proper book! Okay, you might go to the library, but somewhere along the line, someone had to pay for the book. There was no problem with copying because it would have probably cost more money to copy the book than to simply buy one.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After ZCC, yes, it all changed. Wikipedia was copyleft, instantly available and instantly up-to-date, and trounced the competition.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Money]{style="font-weight: bold;"}  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, what about all those good old-fashioned things that fall into the Money category. You can't copy food. If I've got an apple I can eat it or give it to you, but not both. You can copy a recipe, but not the food itself. That's why food is firmly in the Money category. There's no such thing as a free lunch. The same applies to cars. If I've got a car, you can't drive it at the same time. I think I've made my point.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, one more thing. It's popular to talk about 'intellectual property', but this is an oxymoron. It's either an idea, in which case it falls into the Information category, or it's property, in which case it falls into the Money category.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Transition]{style="font-weight: bold;"}  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things only move from Money to Information, never the other way round.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that's in transition at the moment is music. I remember going into a music shop and buying a tape in the eighties. These days most people illegally download music. People think it's prissy of me to abjure illegal downloading. We're in the midst of a transition to something like &lt;a href="http://www.jamendo.com/"&gt;Jamendo&lt;/a&gt;, where music is made available under a copyleft licence.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Future]{style="font-weight: bold;"}  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the short term, we'll see books, newspapers, films, music etc. make the transition from Money to Information.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, when you buy a product like a bike or a car, the total cost is broken down into the design cost and the manufacturing cost. With the coming revolution of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RepRap"&gt;RepRap&lt;/a&gt;, design will move into Information, and the cost of a bike or car will be dramatically brought down to the cost of raw materials and energy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, money will only be useful for buying energy, land and raw materials and transport. Within the home, it'll be possible to fabricate all the needed material things, from computers to food.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Look, look, there it is!</title><link href="/ive-read-several-books-and-things-since.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-11-26T00:28:00+00:00</published><updated>2008-11-26T00:28:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2008-11-26:/ive-read-several-books-and-things-since.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've read several books and things since we last spoke. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distress_%28novel%29"&gt;Distress&lt;/a&gt; is impressive.

Egan's work has the opposite effect, I find that I'm reading the kind of book I'd write if I had the talent.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easy_Rider"&gt;Easy Rider&lt;/a&gt; with Matt and Bill. Matt mentioned that it was one of the first films to use the 'lens flare' technique. At first I didn't quite know what he meant, so the first bit of the film was taken up by him saying, 'look, look, there it is!', and then after I'd got it, I started exclaiming, 'look, look, there it is!' whenever it appeared.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd been meaning to read Norman Mailer for some time. Ever since I saw him in some old footage of a debate with Germain Greer in fact. &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gospel_According_to_the_Son"&gt;The Gospel According to the Son&lt;/a&gt; is probably not a typical Mailer. I like the way that Mailer's Jesus has private doubts, but I did find the miracles and talking to God and the devil a bit hard to accept. He did get the biblical tone right.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Baader-Meinhoff Complex is, I understand, a controversial film. What the Baader-Meinhoff gang did was wrong. Why? On a formal level I'd say it's wrong because they broke the letter and spirit of the law in a democracy. Do I think the laws against blowing people up are right? Yes. I believe the laws maximize the aggregate freedom of the citizens.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="book-review"></category><category term="film-review"></category></entry><entry><title>The evolution of homosexuality</title><link href="/evolution-of-homosexuality.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-11-25T23:18:00+00:00</published><updated>2008-11-25T23:18:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2008-11-25:/evolution-of-homosexuality.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Toby at work pointed out an &lt;a href="http://www.economist.com/science/displayStory.cfm?source=hptextfeature&amp;amp;story_id=12465295"&gt;article in The Economist&lt;/a&gt; describing a new theory of the evolution of homosexuality.

&lt;p&gt;and a reply from Graham Watson MEP:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am aware that there is growing debate as to the best way of protecting intellectual property with regard to software, but at the same time not stifling competition or the evolution of this technology. It has equally been suggested that copyright makes innovation more difficult as it allows companies like Microsoft to monopolise undefined areas of software, and that such copyright can only be challenged through the court system, unlike patents which are only granted after rigorous examination. Thank you for drawing this issue to my attention and I will certainly bear in mind your comments when this issue is next reviewed by the Parliament If I can be of any assistance in the future, please do not hesitate to contact me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel I should reply to Graham, as it seems he has some misconceptions. The problem is that I'm not an expert either. Well, here's my reply:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graham, thank you for your response to my email about software patents. You write:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has equally been suggested that copyright makes innovation more difficult as it allows companies like Microsoft to monopolise undefined areas of software...  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can copyright allow a single company to monopolise an area? Copyright doesn't prevent anyone from using the &lt;em&gt;ideas&lt;/em&gt; in a piece of software, it just prevents them from copying / modifying / distributing the code for that &lt;em&gt;particular&lt;/em&gt; piece of software without permission.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the field of web browsers for example, the fact that Microsoft's Internet Explorer has copyright restrictions hasn't stiffled competitors such as Mozilla. In fact I'm using Mozilla to write this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You add:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and that such copyright can only be challenged through the court system, unlike patents which are only granted after rigorous examination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Mozilla didn't have to challenge anyone in the courts in order to write their web browser. This is in contrast to patents. If Microsoft had been able to patent the web browser, nobody else would have been able to make a competing product and the world would be all the poorer.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I say yes to software copyright, no to software patents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say yes to both, but the BDFL said no. I say yes because it makes code more readable, reduces the chance of error, and doesn't seem to have any great disadvantages. In the example, instead of &lt;code&gt;if []:&lt;/code&gt; I would write &lt;code&gt;if len([]) &amp;gt; 0:&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;The pulleys on the conventional rear derailleur are there to maintain tension in the chain, because otherwise as you change to a smaller sprocket, the chain would become slack.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason that software patents are so bad is that it's so difficult, time consuming and expensive to avoid violating them. One has to hire expensive patent lawyers etc. This is in contrast to copyright, where it's easy to avoid copying someone else's work. So I believe that copyright is adequate for people who want their software to be proprietary.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please deliver us from the dead hand of software patents!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subject covers the spectrum from taking the basic molecules of life and using new variants to do new things, to using existing DNA and recombining it in different ways.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speaker quoted Richard Feynman saying something like, 'to really understand an idea, you have to use it to build something'. So the lab is trying to understand biology by using it to build something new.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's something that offends the religious in creating life. It's as though being able to create life is either an affront to God, or somehow shows that he doesn't exist.

&lt;p&gt;Well, I'm divagating. One of the characters, James Egerton, explains that Saint Augustine thought that evil wasn't a thing in itself, but rather an absence of good.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capote_%28film%29"&gt;Capote&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, and the message seemed to be that Capote was wrong to manipulate the trial in order to suit his own writing. Of course this was wrong, but it's the kind of wrong that still gives me hope. I think the worst thing is nihilism, where nothing matters.

The key bit for me was:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a pure free market position which holds that no financial institution should be bailed out – ever. If this approach was followed, people would factor much more risk into their behaviour and the world would be a better place – eventually. I have some sympathy for the intellectual purity of this position – but that is all. On balance, I think it would be rather a good idea, you know, if we did not repeat the Great Depression all over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm one of those that take the 'pure free market' position. I follow the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression#Austrian_School_explanations"&gt;Austrian School of thought on the Great Depression&lt;/a&gt;:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Austrian view it was this inflation of the money supply that led to an unsustainable boom in both asset prices (stocks and bonds) and capital goods. By the time the Fed belatedly tightened in 1928, it was far too late and, in the Austrian view, a depression was inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The artificial interference in the economy was a disaster prior to the Depression, and government efforts to prop up the economy after the crash of 1929 only made things worse. According to Rothbard, government intervention delayed the market's adjustment and made the road to complete recovery more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

I wasn't disappointed. Perhaps Axiomatic is the superior collection? Written in 1995, it's way ahead of its time. The sort of things Egan writes about, free will, the neurological basis for decision making, parallel universes, brain and body modification and consciousness, are all things I find myself thinking about.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm still getting to grips with the idea of short stories. Each one of Egan's short stories has enough meat on it to be a novel. Now I've allowed short stories into my life, they seem to just keep on coming. Prowling through the shelves of Bath Central Library I came upon an Alasdair Gray collection of short stories called 'The Ends Of Our Tethers'. Zoe had &lt;a href="http://blog.tlocke.org.uk/2007/03/poor-things.html"&gt;given me Poor Things&lt;/a&gt; and that and his reputation made me give Ends a try.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On reading the first story, some may think Professor Gray a bit pervy. Well, I think Gray has a unique voice. His scottishness is continually present, and his left wingery is put forth unashamedly. Actually, I do have an issue with his socialism. Socialists come in two flavours, those who propound a complete world-view and those that just take pot shots at free-markets and capitalism. The complete world-view types are more honest, but reveal themselves and socialism to be bonkers. The pot shotters are saner, but don't really have a viable alternative. Gray is a pot-shotter.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't go away with the idea that I didn't like the book.

&lt;p&gt;I instinctively disagree with this. Thinking further, there are two reasons for disagreeing:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issues that David is talking about are political problems rather than scientific problems. The solution to many of these problems is a world government, not a change in funding priorities.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have good government, then science and technology is important to people's quality of life. With fundamental research, you never know where it's going to lead. Often there are practical applications that result. For example, would David have cut research into quantum mechanics? If so, he would have damaged the computer industry, and I wouldn't have been able to read his views on the BBC website, or be able to post this response.&lt;/p&gt;

I never finished it, and I keep meaning to come back to it. It was different from anything I had read before, and I found that it both shocked and appealed to me.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I saw Camus' The Plague at the library I pounced. The plague is obviously a metaphor for Nazism, and the resistance against the plague is the French resistance, which Camus was involved in. As I've said before I avoid allegory and metaphor like the plague. So I read it as if it were a real plague in a real town. The character I identified with was Cottard. I was a bit worried therefore when he went mad at the end and started shooting at people. Cottard actually liked the plague because it meant that for the first time, he was in the same boat as everyone else.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was something else I meant to say, but it escapes me. Anyway, I've got to go and clean the house as I've got people coming round.

&lt;p&gt;The later chapters of Dennet's book were more convincing than the first chapters, but the book was interesting all the way through. Dennet tried to convince me that even in a deterministic universe, things can be avoided, and the important features of free-will are preserved. I just couldn't go along with this argument. Surely, in a deterministic world, all events are pre-determined, and one doesn't really have freedom of choice.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The later chapters give a multiverse approach to crime and punishment. I really liked this idea. It says that if most of the nearby universes lead to a particular event, you shouldn't be held responsible for it. However, if there are thick clumps of universes nearby that don't lead to that event, then you can be said to be responsible. In other words, if you had done things a bit differently the thing wouldn't have happened.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dennet doesn't call it a 'multiverse approach', and he doesn't describe it as I have, this is just my take on it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello,  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In France, jars of chocolate spread, mustard etc, are often designed so that you can re-use them as drinking-glasses when the contents are used up.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems like a good idea, so I was wondering why we don't take this approach …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've emailed &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesco"&gt;Tesco&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href="http://blog.tlocke.org.uk/2008/08/jars-to-glasses.html"&gt;re-using jars as glasses&lt;/a&gt;:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems like a good idea, so I was wondering why we don't take this approach in the UK? Perhaps jars are more expensive to manufacture if they are designed to be re-used.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to publish this enquiry, and your response, on my blog. Let me know if that isn't okay with you.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your help with this query,  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a morally complex batman film. I saw it as an allegory of the 'war on terror' / war in Iraq, with The Joker as Osama Bin Laden and Batman as the US military.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue of torture arose, in the classic situation of a person refusing to say where the ticking bomb is. Batman resorted to torture, like water-boarding carried out by the US. I listened to The Moral Maze on torture, and was horrified to find myself agreeing that it was right to use it in certain circumstances. I can't remember the reasoning and if someone asked me now, I'd say torture is never justified.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another part of the war on terror is surveillance. In &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Knight_%28film%29"&gt;The Dark Knight&lt;/a&gt;, batman hacks into everyone's mobile phone and builds up a sonar picture of the city.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the cold war comes into this film! In an analogy of the cold war, each ship can destroy the other at the touch of a button. To have the best chance of surviving, it's rational to press the button straight away.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fate has ordained that the problem of free will occupy my mind. Batman has to choose between saving the life of the woman he loves, or the life of the man he believes can save the city from crime. Is his choice determined from the beginning of the universe, and even if not, does he have any real control over his choice?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a great film, but for me the moral choices are clear. Batman shouldn't go around breaking the law, he should respect it like any other citizen, no exceptions. Equally, the UK / US shouldn't have undertaken an illegal war against Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="film-review"></category></entry><entry><title>Radio 1, Bebo and Grim Dog</title><link href="/radio-1-bebo-and-grim-dog.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-08-24T19:34:00+01:00</published><updated>2008-08-24T19:34:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2008-08-24:/radio-1-bebo-and-grim-dog.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Listening to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Switch"&gt;Switch&lt;/a&gt;, I heard Nick 'Grimmy' Grimshaw, mention &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bebo"&gt;Bebo&lt;/a&gt; loads of times, without mentioning any other social networking site.

This afternoon I walked in the rain to Saint Barthelemy for my customary [presion]{style="font-style: italic;"}, and then back towards Chamblard.

&lt;p&gt;I hopped from the bank to a rock, lost my footing and landed up standing in a shallow part of the stream. I got onto another rock, then tried to wade across. I again lost my footing, but it was a deep part of the stream so I had to start swimming in the fast flowing water. I made it to the other side, but it was foolhardy to take the risk of crossing.  &lt;/p&gt;

He died on 25th June this year, aged 69. When I was a teenager in the 80s, LW meant a great deal to me. I read a few of his books at that time: Dreams of Dragons, Gifts of Unknown Things, Neophilia, The Romeo Error and The Nature Of Things. I was also heavily influenced by an interview with him in The Sunday Times. Then more recently I read Supernature and Dark Nature.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me at that time, LW in his life and work gave me an alternative, a chink of light in the gloom. I had been brought up a Christian, but was learning science at school. Prayer, souls, miracles, heaven and hell didn't feature in physics.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem was that my entire world view depended on Christianity, and was being undermined by science. I was psychologically incapacitated for about a year and a half while I wrestled with this relentless doubt.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end I realized that science and Christianity were incompatible, and that current science offered the best explanation for how the world worked. I started to describe myself as an atheist.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LW was important to me because he was a scientist who seemed to offer some hope. I'm a bit embarassed to admit to having had a hero, but Lyall Watson was a hero to me.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>/var/lib/tomcat5.5/webapps</title><link href="/varlibtomcat55webapps.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-07-26T18:08:00+01:00</published><updated>2008-07-26T18:08:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2008-07-26:/varlibtomcat55webapps.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've used GNU/Linux since (February?) 1999.

My friend Bill made the comment that it may well be of interest to academics, but it has no appreciable effect in the real world. So here's a rough calculation for the power an irreversible computer needs that's operating right at the Landauer limit. For each bit the energy used per switch is T * k * ln 2. Assume a 2 GHz processor, 5 GB of RAM, and room temperature:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;power = 293 * 1.38 * 10\^-23 * ln 2 * 2 * 10\^9 * 5 * 10\^9  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\~ 0.01 W  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we can times this by 100 because k*ln 2 is just the theoretical minimum that can never be reached.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\~ 1 W  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with Moore's law, this limit will become increasingly significant.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've no idea if this calculation is correct, I just made it up to prove my own point! Can someone correct me please?&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Two-rate electricity meter (continued)</title><link href="/two-rate-electricity-meter-continued.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-07-10T21:33:00+01:00</published><updated>2008-07-10T21:33:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2008-07-10:/two-rate-electricity-meter-continued.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Good Energy have replied to

It's not like Jonah and the Whale.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember everyone talking about The Beach, and then there was the film and the song. I never seemed to read the book or see the film, but I heard Pure Shores on the radio quite a bit. My brother had the book and said it was good, but I remained a bit of a grumpy skeptic.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then heard about Alex Garland having writer's block. Is this true? This actually pushed me slightly in the direction of reading TB. Then it somehow came up in conversation with Anita at work. She said it was one of her favourite books, she brought it in.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It really is enjoyable, and a bit shocking. Shades of Lord of the Flies perhaps? The protagonist is not someone I'd be friends with in real life. The narrator presents the tale as an allegory of the Vietnam war. I think Thomas Hobbes would have regarded it as a story of what happens to people in 'the state of nature' when there's no Leviathan. Or perhaps Sal is the Leviathan. You've got me confused now.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's move on to the Animated film Akira. Surely I can't go wrong with a cartoon. Can I? My highlight is when the hero has hallucinations. I don't think I've ever had an actual hallucination, but it seemed like you could show that bit of the film to people to give them an idea of what it's like to have a mental illness that grotesquely distorts reality.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I've got to return the book to Anita, and it's in a poor state after being carried round in my bag for ages. Hope she's okay about that...&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="book-review"></category><category term="film-review"></category></entry><entry><title>Thanks for your encouragement.

&lt;p&gt;So my plan is to rent out my garden as an allotment, through the district council. Apparently there's a shortage of allotments, and the district council already has a scheme set up. I'll let you know what happens.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm giving this the CO2 footprint label because:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wouldn't have to mow the back garden every week, which causes CO2 emissions.&lt;/li&gt;

My hope is that the house will use a bit less gas, and emit a bit less CO2.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other reasons why I installed a water softener are:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I intend to install solar water heating, and I don't want its heat exchanger to be impaired by limescale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less time cleaning the bathroom, and no money to spend on anti-limescale cleaners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The washing machine and other appliances should last longer. In my previous house the loo stopped working because of limescale building up!  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model I had installed is a Kinetico 2020c. This softener doesn't use any electricity, it uses water pressure to refresh the ion exchange chamber with brine, so the only consumable is salt.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regular readers (hey don't snigger, there's at least one &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt;) will
remember I
&lt;a href="/scale-of-problem.html"&gt;talked about getting a magnetic water softener&lt;/a&gt; ages ago.

&lt;p&gt;[Monte Verita]{style="font-weight: bold;"}  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exemplifies many of the qualities of dM's writing:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ability to create an air of the supernatural, but without anything supernatural actually happening. She never weakens her story by descending into supernatural explanations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insightful portrayals of male characters. I go as far as to say that dM is better at writing about men than women.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great clarity of writing, including when writing about mysterious things. dM uses precise language and acute observation to convey emotions and an atomosphere that are subtle and elusive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I particularly like the way dM evokes the world of the past. Here the protagonist talks of his stay with a friend:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...I had all the same comforts - cans of hot water, early tea, biscuits by my bed, cigarette box filled, all the touches of a thoughtful hostess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The Apple Tree]{style="font-weight: bold;"}  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just didn't know what to make of this. Can someone help me and tell me what to think? Is he or his wife the baddie?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The Little Photographer]{style="font-weight: bold;"}  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So convincingly rendered that I felt like [I]{style="font-style: italic;"} had committed the murder. It's funny, you hear a lot about computer games encouraging criminality, but you rarely hear Daphne du Maurier cited as a corrupter of the young.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Kiss Me Again, Stranger]{style="font-weight: bold;"}  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, well at least continue reading.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The Old Man]{style="font-weight: bold;"}  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genuinely surprised and delighted by this. I won't go into it 'cause I'll spoil it for you if you haven't read it. This story really stayed with me. Actually that's another thing about dM. She shows exquisite judgement in controlling the release of information as a story progresses. So much so that I'm sure that if you re-read one of her stories it would seem new.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="book-review"></category></entry><entry><title>Trowbridge Central Elections 10th July 2008</title><link href="/trowbridge-central-elections-10th-july.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-06-16T11:44:00+01:00</published><updated>2008-06-16T11:44:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2008-06-16:/trowbridge-central-elections-10th-july.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've just got my polling card for the &lt;a href="http://www.westwiltshire.gov.uk/index/council/democratic_processes_and_events/elections-voting/elections-forthcoming/trowbridge-central-100708.htm"&gt;Trowbridge Central Elections 10th July 2008&lt;/a&gt; but I can't find a list of who's standing, so I don't know how to vote.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave went on to give his view:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically the green revolution has bankrupted all the rice farmers in Thailand, and I guess the same pattern is repeated worldwide.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much as the banks have bankrupted middle class people in the West, capitalism has done the same for poor farmers throughout the world, whereas they feed most people and are the most productive.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Thailand, the fact that the middle men, the rice dealers and the millers are all chums with the politicians who allow them to bankrupt the rice farmers even while food prices are at an all time high, is openly discussed in the English newspapers in Thailand.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same thing happens in the West but it is openly discussed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding agriculture, this seems to be an inevitable consequence of many indfidually weak farmers, who can be preyed about but a much smaller cartel of rice dealers.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way the Thai farmers have got the promise of a fair deal is to threaten to blockade all the major roads.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free markets are a way to make a society as a whole richer. It doesn't mean that wealth will be distributed equally. If you want a more equal distribution of wealth, you have to tax rich people more, and give everyone a 'citizen's allowance'.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Thailand the free market has worked, in that the country is getting richer. Richer doesn't mean happier of course. I could make more money if I had a second job stacking shelves in Tesco's, but I prefer to forgo the money and spend the time arguing with you, oh joy!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You talk about cartels of middle-men, but if these exist there isn't a fully free market. The government needs to improve regulation to break the cartels. You say that the politicians are unduly influenced by the middle-men. This is exactly what Adam Smith warns about in The Wealth of Nations. I'm afraid the only way round this is for individuals to campaign, unite, protest, denounce and vote! To paraphrase Jefferson; the price of (market) freedom is eternal vigilance.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>The consistency of fat</title><link href="/consistency-of-fat.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-06-12T12:49:00+01:00</published><updated>2008-06-12T12:49:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2008-06-12:/consistency-of-fat.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I put up my hand at every opportunity, but to no avail.

&lt;p&gt;We were shown a series of maps of America; one for each year from the early 90s to today, showing the level of obesity. It showed a dramatic increase. Much of the talk focussed on how to engineer food to taste fatty but not cause weight gain. Apparently we sense fat by its consistency rather than its taste.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speaker did point out a problem with such food, in that anorexics might eat nothing but that type of food, when in fact they need [more]{style="font-style: italic;"} fat in their diet.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>To The Hermitage</title><link href="/to-hermitage.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-06-10T22:44:00+01:00</published><updated>2008-06-10T22:44:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2008-06-10:/to-hermitage.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Reading &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Bradbury"&gt;To The Hermitage&lt;/a&gt; was

I don't support the campaign, and here's why.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's assume that levels of CO2 are okay up to 450 ppm. Since there's an upper limit, it means we've got to use the CO2 emissions we're allowed, to their best effect. Perhaps UK air travel is the best way to use some of our permitted emissions? Or perhaps not.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way to enforce a CO2 limit while making sure the emissions are used most wisely, is to raise the global cost of emissions through a carbon tax until the permitted level of CO2 is reached. The revenue from such a tax should be distributed equally amongst the world's population.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the climate change aspect of airport expansions is taken out of the equation, problem solved!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Tradable</title><link href="/tradable.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-05-31T18:11:00+01:00</published><updated>2008-05-31T18:11:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2008-05-31:/tradable.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I really like contributing to Wiktionary.

&lt;p&gt;Toby at work showed me the &lt;a href="http://www.energywatch.org.uk/help_and_advice/green_tariffs/guarantees.asp"&gt;Energy Watch comparison&lt;/a&gt; of how different tariffs treat ROCs and LECs. I would retire 100% of the ROCs and LECs. I realize that this would mean that the tariff would be very expensive, but hey, it's green!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Wireless Meters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the UK most domestic electricity meters are manually read by a person in a van. A less carbon intensive method is to have wireless meters that are like a mobile phone stuck to an electricity meter. The meter is read by a computer ringing up the meter.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Half-hourly meters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electricity is cheapest at night, and most expensive in the evening. I should be able to set my dishwasher to come on at one o'clock in the morning and pay half the amount! I can't at the moment because my meter can't tell the difference between night and day, and I bet yours can't either. A half-hourly meter measures the amount of electricity used every half hour. Good Energy should install a HH meter in one's house.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Google App Engine</title><link href="/google-app-engine.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-05-20T20:28:00+01:00</published><updated>2008-05-20T20:28:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2008-05-20:/google-app-engine.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I set out to port &lt;a href="http://www.own-id.com/"&gt;Own-Id&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/"&gt;Google App Engine&lt;/a&gt; but failed because Own-Id relies on people being able to point their own host name to the Own-Id app. This only works because Own-Id has its own IP address.

&lt;p&gt;What sticks in my mind from the talk is the fact that CO2 emissions are proportional to the weight of the car, and inversely proportional to engine efficiency. Engine efficiency has improved enormously over the years, but today's Mini is twice the weight of the original, and I believe the same is true of the Fiesta. The result is that CO2 per km hasn't improved a great deal.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of the extra weight is a side effect of making cars a lot safer. Can we have low emissions cars that are safe? Surely we can.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My French friend Pascal gave a cheer when it was revealed that Peugeot / Citroen were the most likely to make low CO2 cars.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My bet for the future is on electric cars. The &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Roadster"&gt;Tesla Roadster&lt;/a&gt; is already comparatively cheap to run, and with oil prices rising, I think the public will gravitate to the electric car.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Own-Id 004</title><link href="/own-id-004.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-05-05T13:02:00+01:00</published><updated>2008-05-05T13:02:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2008-05-05:/own-id-004.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just released a new version of &lt;a href="http://www.own-id.com/"&gt;Own-Id&lt;/a&gt;.

Having said that, there are a few things I take issue with him on:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intellectual property.&lt;/strong&gt; Kurzweil says that as technology progresses, more things become information. This I agree with, but he goes on to say that it is important to protect the information so you have money to create new things. Here he's trying to perpetuate the idea of intellectual property. I believe that information can't be treated as property, and should be released as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_content"&gt;free content&lt;/a&gt;. You may then ask, how do you make the money to build new things? Well, free content is often available for no charge, but most of the inputs to creating knowledge is other knowledge, so substantially less money would be needed. Okay, but where do you get the small amount of money that is necessary? Well, advertising is the popular method. I'm sure Wikipedia could make an enormous amount of money if carried advertising.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consciousness.&lt;/strong&gt; I'm pleased that Kurzweil devoted some of the book to the problem of consciousness. Unfortunately nobody understands it yet as far as I can see. I think Kurzweil accepts that it is essential for our post-biological successors to be conscious. So until we understand consciousness and can recreate it artificially, I think it's difficult to make predictions.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The structure of society.&lt;/strong&gt; Kurzweil quotes Hobbes, 'the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short' to support his case that improved technology leads to a better standard of living. But Hobbes wasn't merely talking about technology, he was describing life in an unstructured society, an anarchy, or what he called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviathan_%28book%29#Part_I:_Of_Man"&gt;'the state of nature'&lt;/a&gt;. Hobbes' point was that for life to improve and for technology to develop, a structured society is needed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I'm disappointed that Kurzweil does not realize the importance of the structure of society. Indeed, Kurzweil talks of the military applications of nanotechnology, but this is like our ancestors talking of how in the far future, technology will be used to defend our village from attacks from other villages. Thankfully we have national &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviathan_%28book%29"&gt;Leviathans&lt;/a&gt; in the form of democratically elected governments that means that each village doesn't have to defend against its neighbouring village. I predict a global Leviathan, a democratically elected world government, so that countries don't have to worry about defending themselves against other countries.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="book-review"></category></entry><entry><title>Ender's Game</title><link href="/enders-game.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-04-27T12:27:00+01:00</published><updated>2008-04-27T12:27:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2008-04-27:/enders-game.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Somehow I already knew the basic idea behind Ender's Game.

&lt;p&gt;Ender's Game did not disappoint. Perhaps the aim of sci-fi is to combine a brilliant idea with a gripping story. Ender's Game certainly did that, and it's lasting reputation is deserved.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One gripe I have when writing about books and films is that many of them aren't &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_content"&gt;free content&lt;/a&gt;. I'm part of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Culture_movement"&gt;free culture movement&lt;/a&gt;. I'm in favour of the idea of property for physical things, but intellectual property is an oxymoron. When you're talking about information, a whole new set of rules apply. You should be able to do anything you like with information; copy it, sell it, modify it, whatever. The only thing you shouldn't be able to do is remove these freedoms.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="book-review"></category></entry><entry><title>Lars and the Real Girl</title><link href="/lars-and-real-girl.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-04-20T22:15:00+01:00</published><updated>2008-04-20T22:15:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2008-04-20:/lars-and-real-girl.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Moving, emotional, satisfying.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_recovery_ventilation"&gt;Heat Recovery Ventilation&lt;/a&gt;. I intend to install this in my house. My question was, 'what if there's a power cut in the night, will everyone asphyxiate?!!'. The feeling was that there'd be enough air in the house for everyone to survive, and then they could simply open a window when they awoke.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On-site electricity generation.&lt;/strong&gt; In the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_for_Sustainable_Homes"&gt;Code for Sustainable Homes&lt;/a&gt;, there is a bias towards local generation. I'm disappointed in this. It may be more efficient to have a huge distant off-shore wind farm than numerous local turbines. Government should restrict itself to increasing the cost of CO2 pollution through &lt;a href="http://sites.google.com/a/tlocke.org.uk/tlocke/1"&gt;CO2 TaxBack&lt;/a&gt;, and leave the detailed choices about generation to the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greywater"&gt;Grey water&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;recycling.&lt;/strong&gt; The speaker, an architect, said he used to be skeptical of grey water recycling as he hadn't yet seen it done properly. What changed his mind was the &lt;a href="http://ecoplay-system.com/"&gt;EcoPlay system&lt;/a&gt;. This costs about £1,500 and replaces the cistern in the downstairs loo. It fills up with water from the shower / bath upstairs, and then uses it to flush the loo. If the grey water hasn't been used after a certain period, it is discarded to avoid the water going bad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Water softerners.&lt;/strong&gt; I'm about to install a water softener in my house, and I wanted to know whether it was a good idea on environmental grounds. The speaker said he didn't know definitively, but he was installing one in his house for practical reasons.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some say that if your country's people are going hungry, it's madness to be &lt;em&gt;exporting&lt;/em&gt; food, so food exports should be banned. The problem is that this depresses prices, which again leads to a decrease in supply.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the real problem is that some people are poor. In the UK we actually tax the poor, and I've heard it said that poor people pay more tax as a proportion of their wealth than rich people. All taxes that aren't related to income should be abolished. This includes National Insurance and VAT. How would this be paid for?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ending agricultural subsidies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legalizing prostitution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legalizing drugs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abolishing the national minimum wage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freeing up trade by ending protectionism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's why RTFO is a bad idea:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say I take a (diesel) train to work, but I've adapted my house so that it is zero carbon. My neighbour cycles to work but lives in a draughty house. Even if our carbon emissions are the same, our penalties aren't the same. There's a higher price for emitting carbon by burning diesel than for the same emissions from burning gas to heat a house.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, you may concede that the penalties for CO2 emissions aren't the same, but why is that so bad?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above example, you could say that I should live like my neighbour (I shouldn't have insulated my house and I should cycle to work) and then I wouldn't be paying a higher CO2 penalty. This would have a detrimental effect on my finances because a local job would be less well paid, and so would be detrimental effect to the economy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, having unequal penalties for different ways of emitting CO2 is worse for the economy than having single penalty rate for all types of CO2 emissions.

It seems to me that one of the reasons why evolution is a better theory than ID is because ID begs the question, 'Who designed the designer?'. Burgess would probably reply that if there are instances where evolution doesn't provide an explanation, there must have been an intelligent designer. In an &lt;a href="http://www.rationalist.org.uk/newhumanist/issue02summer/creationism.shtml" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;font color="#497fb1" size="+0"&gt;article&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; he has co-authored he explains his view on creationism. He says:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;According to evolution, the immense information that exists in the world has arisen by genetic mistakes. However, according to information theory, information cannot spontaneously arise by random processes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Surely information &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; spontaneously arise by random processes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you look at clouds going by, sooner or later you'll see something you recognize. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes there's a story in the media about a stain on wallpaper that looks like the face of Jesus. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vegetables in rude shapes were always on That's Life on British TV.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
The point is that some rare mutations in DNA will make it better adapted to its environment, but most of the mutations will disappear. We're only seeing today the DNA that has had beneficial mutations throughout its history. So the mutations are random, but whether they persist is not random, it's determined by the environment. Burgess goes on to say:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A bird cannot have evolved from any land creature because all the mechanisms needed for flight are very different from anything required for land. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Hold on, are they that different? I'm no biologist, but a bat doesn't look completely different from a rat. What about those halfway-house mammals that glide from tree to tree?The talk In Stuart Burgess's talk, he focussed on the beauty of nature. Stuart is a professor of engineering and his exposition of the aesthetic aspect of nature was very illuminating. He presented with great clarity with excellent use of visuals and audio. Stuart went on to ask how this beauty could have arisen. He said it was inconcievable that it could have arisen by accident, so there must have been an intelligent designer.&lt;br&gt;
At the end of the talk there was an opportunity to ask questions. I put up my hand ready to ask, 'If there's an intelligent designer, who designed this intelligent designer?'. But I wasn't picked.&lt;br&gt;
One of the problems with the talk was that he didn't explain Darwinism properly. He said that beauty doesn't arise randomly, but that's not true. Most mutations detract from beauty, but occasionally one happens that increases beauty. Where beauty is an advantage to that organism it persists, while the other mutations don't survive. Over a very long time, beautiful organisms gradually arise.&lt;br&gt;
I'm very glad I went along, Stuart Burgess showed us loads of interesting stuff. He didn't show that Intelligent Design is a better theory than evolution though.&lt;/div&gt;

The jacket read, 'they tell us not to panic...the lights will go out...people will walk the devastated streets...civilization will be at the point of no return'. If that's meant to cheer me up, I'd hate Bob to recommend me a depressing book.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book's about an artificial &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_oil"&gt;peak oil&lt;/a&gt; scenario. Over the past few year, I've found myself circulating in a milieu of peak oil buffs, and their feeling is that global civilization could well collapse. I disagree.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As oil runs out, its price will increase. This will make alternative sources of energy steadily more attractive, and the world will switch to those.My detractors say, 'Tony, you can't just leave it to the free market. We need government intervention NOW!'.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
I got to 9:41 into the video and found the bit that I disagreed with.&lt;br&gt;
So I agree with the first bit where the central bank (in this case the&lt;br&gt;
federal reserve) creates money by giving the bank a cheque. Then the&lt;br&gt;
video goes on to say that when a deposit is made, 90% is invested and&lt;br&gt;
10% is kept. This is correct, but it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; money creation. Putting&lt;br&gt;
money into a bank account that pays interest is an &lt;em&gt;investment&lt;/em&gt;. If&lt;br&gt;
you want to avoid investing, then put the money in a safe deposit box.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Joe writes:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You are missing the point - with fractional reserve banking you end up with 10 times as much cash in circulation as the original deposit. It is money creation. It is loaned into existance.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Tony writes:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If you have £100 and deposit it in a bank, they'll store £10 and invest the rest on your behalf. That £90 that they invest may well end up being deposited in a bank, and so on, but there's still only £100 in existence, no money has been created.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Joe writes:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In your scenario there is now £190 in existance. the original person still has £100 and now the next person has £90 that they need to pay back with interest. This cash is can be used to bid up priced and is inflationary.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
Without wanting to sound patronising there are plenty of explanations about how it works and with different scenarios.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Tony writes:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
No, there's still only the £100 pounds. When it says £100 on your bank&lt;br&gt;
balance, it seems like you've actually got £100, but really the bank's&lt;br&gt;
gone off and invested £90, so you've actually got £10 and a promise&lt;br&gt;
from the bank that it'll &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; and get you the £90 back if you&lt;br&gt;
withdraw it. So sometimes you get a 'run' on the bank, where everyone&lt;br&gt;
tries to get their original investment back, but that can't be done&lt;br&gt;
immediately (and maybe not at all) because they've only got the £10&lt;br&gt;
that they didn't invest. If the bank made good investments with your&lt;br&gt;
money they'll get it back eventually, but if not then you'll never see&lt;br&gt;
your money again. Unless of course the tax payer bails the bank out.&lt;br&gt;
But at no stage does the bank create new money, only the central bank&lt;br&gt;
can do that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Things To Take On Holiday</title><link href="/things-to-take-on-holiday.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-03-15T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2008-03-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2008-03-15:/things-to-take-on-holiday.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Things to take on holiday.&lt;br&gt;

sleepy and irritable throughout the day. This happens every day. It started a few months ago.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The same symtoms occured a couple of years ago and I went to see my doctor, and I underwent a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_oximetry" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;font color="#497fb1"&gt;pulse oximetry&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; study.&lt;br&gt;
The results were normal. After a while the symtoms subsided.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This time I was hesitant about going to the doctor because the tests from last time were negative. However, I am convinced that&lt;br&gt;
something is wrong. So I bought a pulse oximiter. There's an example graph below:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;div style="DISPLAY:block;TEXT-ALIGN:left"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;img alt="Oximetry" src="/images/2008/oximetry.png"&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The results showed an ODI (oxygen desaturation index) of 0.6 which well within normal levels (I think). So my&lt;br&gt;
current theory is that I've got &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Airway_Resistance_Syndrome_%28UARS%29" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;font color="#497fb1"&gt;Upper Airway Resistance Syndrome (UARS)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I think the best way to test this theory is&lt;br&gt;
to use a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPAP" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;font color="#497fb1"&gt;CPAP&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; device and see if the symptoms improve. In the UK a prescription is required for this, so I'll my doctor on Monday.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
On 2nd July 2012 I recorded myself sleeping without using CPAP, and found that my breathing was a bit like Darth Vader's. Slight snoring, but nothing much to speak of.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Vine</title><link href="/vine.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-03-12T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2008-03-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2008-03-12:/vine.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6RLNKivpu8"&gt;Video of Double Guyot method.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

First the cheers:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good that one can edit HTML directly, and the editor keeps the HTML exactly as you wrote it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clean design; little extraneous content outside one's own content boxes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One can edit the navigation box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One can add other boxes (I've added one for the content licence).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the jeers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One can add sites eg. /mysite but one can't have a top level site. The top site is actually the log-in screen. I think one should be able to create a top-level site. In fact, if I was designing the thing, I'd just have one site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's possible to use one's own domain name, but there are severe limitations. I've set up &lt;a href="http://www.tlocke.org.uk/"&gt;http://www.tlocke.org.uk/&lt;/a&gt; to point to my site, but this just redirects to the login page. Not much use if you're setting up a site for general internet use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Sites allows one to to put pages in sub-directories. But one thing we've learnt about wikis is that all pages should be on the top level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I always use the HTML editor. So there should be a setting to go straight to HTML view, rather than going through the hassle of entering the editor each time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does funny redirect thing to links.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've compiled a &lt;a href="http://sites.google.com/a/tlocke.org.uk/tlocke/3"&gt;general wish-list&lt;/a&gt; for things I'd like a wiki to do.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Following a degree in physics I pursued an interest in computer software, working on an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) application in the C programming language. In 1996 I started writing web applications for Open World, an online marketing company for the luxury travel industry. I worked with large travel companies such as Intercontinental Hotels and Hyatt Hotels. In 2001 I joined Wessex Water and developed an expertise in electricity bill processing, writing the &lt;a href="http://chellow.wikispaces.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;font color="#497fb1"&gt;Chellow&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; bill processing software. I am a fan of the internet, free software, free culture and wikis. My other Free Software projects are &lt;a href="http://imprimatur.wikispaces.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;font color="#497fb1"&gt;Imprimatur&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (a web application testing tool), and &lt;a href="http://www.own-id.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;font color="#497fb1"&gt;Own-Id&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (a service for delegating OpenIds). &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Current Skills&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computing skills including web applications with Python, Java, Postgresql and Apache Tomcat. 
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good understanding of electricity bill processing including EDI, MPANs (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter_Point_Administration_Number" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;font color="#497fb1"&gt;contributor to the MPAN article on Wikipedia&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), DUoS, TUoS, CCL, VAT. Experience of handling half-hourly data. 
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintaining relationships with energy suppliers, meter operators, data collectors and DNOs. 
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing a small team of highly talented people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Employment History&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;2001 to present - Wessex Water.&lt;/b&gt; I manage a small team responsible for processing energy bills, electricity supply changes and energy data. The team and I have developed systems to rapidly and accurately check electricity and gas bills and data. These systems also present a timely picture of the organization's energy use and spending. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1995 to 2001 at Open World Limited &lt;/b&gt;- My first project at Open World was to automate the production of a training manual for AT&amp;amp;T. The experience of working for corporate clients throughout the software lifecycle has characterized my time at Open World. When the company moved to specialize in publishing hotel group websites in 1996, I was asked to do the back-end programming. I used the Python scripting language to write a number of CGIs that included a search, emailer (PGP encrypted), relocator and a simple auction. As the traffic to our sites became heavier, it became clear that spawning a new Python process for each CGI request was too inefficient. I decided to use a new architecture of Java Servlets and a relational database. One of the applications I wrote using this new architecture was a currency converter which took feeds from the UN and the IMF. As the applications became more complicated, and the websites themselves became more dynamic, it became clear that I needed to improve the application architecture again. With this new architecture, the applications generate XML, which is then transformed using an XSLT template that most closely fits the browser's content-type, character-encoding and language. For example, if someone with a WAP phone requests a page in Japanese with the Shift-JS encoding, a page will be generated based on an XSL template that most closely matches these criteria based on the HTTP specification. This architecture supports compound documents(documents containing dynamic elements from disparate sources) by using Server Side Includes. 
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1994 to 1995 at APL&lt;/b&gt;. APL are a software company that produces a suite of programs for managing factories. It was my job to enhance the system according to customer requirements. The system was written in 'C' and ran on Unix and MS-DOS, using an Informix relational database. The enhancements ranged from small modifications to existing code, to writing whole new modules. The work involved visiting clients at their sites to discuss projects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

I chose &lt;a href="http://www.good-energy.co.uk/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;font color="#497fb1" size="+0"&gt;Good Energy&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as my electricity supplier. I did a very rough calculation and I think I'm paying something under £5 / month more than I would have done with brown (fossil fuel) electricity. 
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After reading &lt;a href="http://uk.blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-n8mQdaMld6nzBHpvRQIs7zE-?cq=1&amp;amp;p=32" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;font color="#497fb1" size="+0"&gt;Heat&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I've given up flying. There's no way to fly without causing CO2 emissions.

&lt;li&gt;Using an 'organic box' scheme to deliver fruit, vegetables and fish.After reading &lt;a href="http://uk.blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-n8mQdaMld6nzBHpvRQIs7zE-?cq=1&amp;amp;p=32" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;font color="#497fb1" size="+0"&gt;Heat&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I've realized that a delivered organic box is the best way to obtain food. I've put in an order with &lt;a href="http://www.abel-cole.co.uk/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;font color="#497fb1" size="+0"&gt;Abel &amp;amp; Cole&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. My friend Andy Dolman recommended &lt;a href="http://www.riverford.co.uk/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;font color="#497fb1" size="+0"&gt;Riverford&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but being a contrarian I've ignored his wise advice. He'll be proved right of course.
If you go with the right company the organic box idea has the following advantages over a supermarket in terms of climate change: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No air freight, meaning greatly reduced CO2 emissions 
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mainly local produce reduces road travel 
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supermarkets themselves waste a whole lot of energy on heating / cooling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Water softener to make gas boiler more efficient. Also would presumably
help when moving to other sources of heat. Found out from a plumber
that this is possible with my boiler.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Things I intend to do to reduce my CO2 footprint&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Please let me know if these are bogus.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;House&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heat Recovery Ventilation (HRV). This seems to be the next step. The things is, I don't want to go around filling in all the draughty gaps before I've got HRV, otherwise the house will get really stuffy. I've had a quick look at the following HRV systems: 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Daikin &lt;a href="http://www.ventyourhome.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;font color="#497fb1"&gt;HRV system&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Looks good, but doesn't have the intake going through the ground. This method of intake is described in the Passivhaus system. 
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.admsystems.co.uk/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;font color="#497fb1"&gt;ADM&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These people seem to install HRV systems, and aren't tied to a particular brand, so difficult to assess. 
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.vent-axia.com/products/vacas/airminder.asp" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;font color="#497fb1"&gt;http://www.vent-axia.com/products/vacas/airminder.asp&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href="http://www.greenbuildingforum.co.uk/forum/index2.php?DATEIN=tpc_pcrzdkdsa_1164561340&amp;amp;showpage=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;font color="#497fb1"&gt;Useful conversation&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - use low friction ducting, allows a low energy motor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm now leaning towards the idea of single room heat recovery ventilation. It's simpler, and easier to maintain. Products are:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kiltox.co.uk/khrv150eco.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.kiltox.co.uk/khrv150eco.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;http://www.insulation.kingspan.com/uk/literature.htm&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It seems a good idea to use &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_cooling_tubes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;font color="#497fb1"&gt;Earth Cooling Pipes&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to pre-heat the air for the HRV. 
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;At the moment I burn gas in my house for space heating and water heating. I'd like to stop this as it produces CO2. I've got a number of options: 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use electricity directly to heat the space and the water. This has a low initial cost, but high running costs. It may well cause more CO2 emissions, even though it's 'green' electricity. This is because of difficulty about where the greenness of electricity lies. 
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_exchange_heat_pump" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;font color="#497fb1" size="+0"&gt;ground source heat pump&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This means that for every unit of electrical energy, I get 3 units of heat energy out. This has a high initial cost (~£12,000), but lower running costs. 
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People keep telling me that a solar water heater on the roof is a good idea. 
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emily said do these things: 
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you have cavity wall insulation? 
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you have thick loft insulation? 
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you have draught proofing in the house?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm pretty sure I've got cavity wall insulation. I've got a room in my loft, but the sides could probably do with insulating a bit more. Draught proofing: I kind of don't want to make the house too stuffy. I need some sort of heat recovery system where fresh cold incoming air is heated by stale hot outgoing air. 
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worcester do interesting &lt;a href="http://www.worcester-bosch.co.uk/index.php?fuseaction=product.range&amp;amp;con_id=128022&amp;amp;from_id=128022" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;font color="#497fb1"&gt;heat pumps and solar water heating&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (combined) . Worcester say ok to use softened water for hot water, but not in the closed system. Ok to use with solar heating, not sure about groundsource. 
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at the PassivHaus standard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good Energy seem to think that the &lt;a href="http://www.goodenergyshop.co.uk/details.asp?id=88" rel="nofollow"&gt;Shuco Solar Thermal panel&lt;/a&gt; is a good idea.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Insulating wall. Someone wrote: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Internally ... if you have room, try glued-on 100mm Kingspan slabs ("seconds" are available at 20% of the normal price and thirds at 2-3%) then Carlite bonding plaster, painted as required. To hang shelves you'll need a more robust variant. Note the extreme risk of thermal bridging/condensation at masonry cross walls and follow the German advice in order to reduce it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The current situation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Where I live in the UK, in a town called Trowbridge, the only type of public transport that works are taxis. The problem is that they're costly, they pollute, and they cause traffic congestion. Here's a table of all the forms of public transport and their qualities. The last row is my proposed solution.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" width="100%"&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Type of transport&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cost&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pollution&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Traffic Congestion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Convenience&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Comfort&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Speed&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Customer Service&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reliability&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;Taxi&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;High&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;High&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;High&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;Very good&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;Good&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;High&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;Good&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;Good&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;Bus&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;Medium&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;Low&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;Low&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;Very bad&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;Poor&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;Low&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;Poor&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;Very poor&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;Train&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;High&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;Low&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;None&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;Bad&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;Very Good&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;High&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;Poor&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;Poor&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;PT2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;Medium&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;Low&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;Low&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;Good&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;Good&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;High&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;Good&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width="11%"&gt;Good&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Modern mobile phones have GPS built-in to them, so they always know where they are. If I want to travel somewhere, I pick up my phone and click on the map where I want to go. The system (let's call it Public Transport 2.0 or PT2) then knows where I am and where I want to go. PT2 also knows the location of the all the vehicles at its disposal, and where all the other passengers are and where they want to go. Every few seconds it performs an optimization to get everyone to their destination in the shortest possible time.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
For example it may tell me to start walking if I want to, and display an arrow showing which direction to walk in. Simultaneously it may tell a minibus that's about to pass by, to pick me up. The minibus may take me to the town I want to go to, and a car would be waiting to take me to the particular address.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Payment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It always annoys me when my bus journey is slowed down by people having to pay the driver as they board. With PT2 you'd charge your account in advance and then it would be automatically debited as you travel, like a pay-as-you-go phone.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
But how would the vehicles get paid? They'd get paid a standard amount per passenger km, depending on the number of seats in their vehicle.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Quality control&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It's important that the vehicles are clean and comfortable, and that the driver is courteous. Each passenger could give feedback via their mobile, and reports would be investigated by PT2 staff. Poor quality would be punished with a fine, and good quality rewarded with a bonus.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Matter and Information</title><link href="/matter-and-information.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-03-06T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2008-03-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2008-03-06:/matter-and-information.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;div style="CLEAR:both"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Cost of copying&lt;/h2&gt;
If an item can be copied perfectly with near-zero cost, it's information, otherwise it belongs in the matter realm.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wealth&lt;/h2&gt;
The wealth of a person, country, organization etc. is the sum of matter they have and all the Information in the world. Hold on, surely the wealthiest person is the one with most money? This is true for any moment in time because all information is available to everyone, so matter is only thing that varies. But compare a king from 1,000 years ago to a regular citizen these days. The king would be the wealthiest person, owning an entire country. The regular citizen of today may own a house, car and a few other things. However, if they both were unfortunate enough to suffer from tooth ache, today's citizen would be better off. The difference is information.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Changing categories&lt;/h2&gt;
As technology progresses, items move from Matter to Information. For example, if I wanted to find out about glass I would have had to buy an encyclopeadia. Now I go to Wikipedia.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ownership&lt;/h2&gt;
Things in the Matter category can be owned, but ownership doesn't work for items in the Information category.&lt;/div&gt;

The system worked really well. Ultimately of course, books will be like music, where you just download it. Hopefully books will be licensed under a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_content"&gt;free content&lt;/a&gt; licence.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Rand uses the book to promote her philisophy of objectivism. I think that the book is good, and the philosophy is interesting but not something I can really adopt. Rand says that one should always act in one's own self-interest, she abhors altruism. Well, maybe, but then she goes on to elevate the lone genius, and denigrate working as a group. This clashes with my experience of life. I often swap ideas with other people, to mutual benefit. Cooporation, that's the word. She could have kept her idea of selfishness, because cooperation is often the most selfish option.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does the philosophy work if you're not a genius? Rand doesn't seem to think much of ordinary people, and yet the book is widely read, so &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; must like &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt;! I think the hero of the story, Roark, has a particular type of personality. In fact I know someone a bit like him. It's possibly not what Rand intended, but the book kind of says it's okay to be like Roark if that's your nature. My opinion is that it was wrong of him to dynamite the building.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading the book prompted the question, 'does not being a genius mean you get on with people better?'. Yes, because if you have a technical skill that's very much in demand, you can get by without having to learn how to get on with people.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="book-review"></category></entry><entry><title>The Power that Preserves</title><link href="/power-that-preserves.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-02-24T13:18:00+00:00</published><updated>2008-02-24T13:18:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2008-02-24:/power-that-preserves.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is the last book of the first Thomas Covenant trilogy by Stephen Donaldson.

This must mean that cardboard has such a low value that the District Council has to pay someone to remove it. On the other hand, cardboard must have a higher value than general household waste, otherwise there wouldn't be any point in collecting it seperately.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, by allowing the cardboard recycling bin to overflow, which means residents put cardboard in with the general waste, the District Council is increasing the council tax bill. Is this correct, or am I missing something?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You say that a carbon tax isn't going to happen soon enough. Why? Implementing a CO2 tax is much easier and therefore quicker than with a FIT. The points where fossil fuels enter the country are few, which makes taxation easy, and there is no administrative burden on the renewable generators. In contrast, with FITs the administrative burden in demonstrating renewableness is huge, and falls entirely on the renewable generators. We've seen this problem with ROCs which are terribly onerous.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also say that FIT subsidizes THE solution. It's wrong to say that the only solution is renewables. The other option is to simply not use the electricity in the first place. Under FITs the higher cost of brown electricity goes to subsidizing renewables, under &lt;a href="http://www.tlocke.org.uk/page/1"&gt;CO2 Taxback&lt;/a&gt; the money goes back to the people to spend as they wish. People would be more able to afford to insulate their houses for example.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, FITs don't address the other sources of greenhouse gases, whereas a carbon tax does. Presumably you'd have other schemes to deal with these. The problem with this approach is that you end up with a cost for transport emissions that is different from the cost of emissions from power stations, which leads the consumer to make irrational choices.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Why feed-in tariffs are a bad idea.</title><link href="/why-feed-in-tariffs-are-bad-idea.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-01-30T07:59:00+00:00</published><updated>2008-01-30T07:59:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2008-01-30:/why-feed-in-tariffs-are-bad-idea.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm a member of Greenpeace.

&lt;p&gt;The problem we've got is the emission of greenhouse gases. Therefore we should make it more expensive to emit greenhouse gases, preferably using a &lt;a href="http://www.tlocke.org.uk/page/1"&gt;carbon tax&lt;/a&gt;. The two main problems with the FIT are:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It only affects electricity consumption, which is not the sole cause of CO2 emissions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It subsidises a particular solution (renewable electricity).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that it's the job of government to increase CO2 emissions costs, and it's the job of the market to find ways of avoiding those costs (a complex mix of reduction and renewables).&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Own-Id outage</title><link href="/own-id-outage.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-01-22T21:40:00+00:00</published><updated>2008-01-22T21:40:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2008-01-22:/own-id-outage.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.own-id.com/"&gt;Own-Id&lt;/a&gt; was down from 2008-01-18 15:16 GMT to 2008-01-19 12:47 GMT.

&lt;p&gt;Someone asked, 'what's the story?'. As I started to explain, I realized there were big gaps in my understanding (this happens a lot). My friend Jonathan has read the book and has a better grasp of these things than me, and set me straight on a few points.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other question people ask is, 'what does the last bit mean?'. It seems to be aliens communicating with the human, and trying to find a common visual language. In short, I don't know what it means.  &lt;/p&gt;

The government say that they will not be subsidised by the taxpayer. As long as they really aren't subsidised (including insurance) then that's okay with me, and I'll explain why.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some complain that, 'the UK doesn't have an energy policy', or 'energy is too important to be left to the free market'. I think that the UK is doing absolutely the right thing in having a free market for electricity. There are two genuine problems in energy at the moment, peak fossil fuels and climate change.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With peak fossil fuels our free market means we're well placed to deal with the problem. As fossil fuels run out, their price will increase. As they increase, two things will happen: more renewable generation will become profitable and usage of fossil fuels will decrease. From Adam Smith we know that both of these will happen in such a way as to maximise the [UK's]{#SPELLING_ERROR_0 .blsp-spelling-error} wealth.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, peak fossil fuels won't happen soon enough to avoid climate change, and so we need a &lt;a href="http://www.tlocke.org.uk/page/1"&gt;carbon tax&lt;/a&gt;. A tax on carbon doesn't mean we'll be abandoning our free market.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So back to the original question of nuclear power; this is simply the market working as it should and delivering the best bet in the long and short term.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, I think the companies are mad to build nuclear power stations because:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uranium is running out (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubbert_peak_theory#Fissionable_materials"&gt;peak uranium&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other technologies are improving and look like they'll be more profitable than nukes, when you take into account the huge costs of building and decommissioning and storage of waste.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I could be wrong and it's their money they're wasting! And this illustrates the benefit of free markets; it doesn't depend on a single person or institution having all the answers.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Blood Diamond</title><link href="/blood-diamond.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-01-10T20:04:00+00:00</published><updated>2008-01-10T20:04:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2008-01-10:/blood-diamond.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;An excellent film that brought up all sorts of moral questions.

&lt;p&gt;The Powell dude is incredibly cultured. The breadth and depth of his knowledge is astounding.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He's a [consummate]{#SPELLING_ERROR_0 .blsp-spelling-corrected} master of language. He then goes further and adds quirks that you can only do if you really understand the rules. I think this is partly because of the distance in time between him writing and me reading. In other words everyone talked like that then. The quirks I'm talking about manifest themselves in oddly contracted sentences. Far out daddy-o!  &lt;/p&gt;

I've thought about it on-and-off for several months and I've decided I don't know enough about the history of the period to comment on that particular case.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However in general it is true that free markets as described by Adam Smith did regulate the labour force by starvation. In other words, if the price of labour dropped below a certain point the labourer couldn't feed herself and died of starvation. This reduced the supply of labour, and so the price of labour rose again. It works, but isn't morally acceptable.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good thing about free markets is that they are the quickest way to make your country rich; the bad thing is that the wealth isn't distributed evenly. That's why I think that government should &lt;a href="http://www.tlocke.org.uk/page/11"&gt;stop taxing the poorest in society&lt;/a&gt;, and in this way redistribute the wealth a bit.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="political-manifesto"></category></entry><entry><title>Per capita CO2 emissions</title><link href="/per-capita-co2-emissions.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-12-22T10:22:00+00:00</published><updated>2007-12-22T10:22:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2007-12-22:/per-capita-co2-emissions.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Willem Buiter &lt;a href="http://blogs.ft.com/maverecon/2007/12/---page-margin.html"&gt;writes that per capita CO2 emissions aren't important&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;It's clear to me that to go to war you need permission from the UN in the form of a resolution of the Security Council. The UK tried to secure such a resolution, but was unable to.

&lt;p&gt;I've heard some say, 'Yes, we need to charge people according to how much they throw away'. This is crazy talk because:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People will just dump their rubbish in laybys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's not just a question of volume of rubbish, it's what's in there; and people don't have the time or expertise to differentiate levels of disposability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My solution is to have a disposal tax on every product that will ultimately be thrown away. There would be a number of categories depending on how costly particular materials are to dispose of. For example a paper bag would be in a cheaper category than a plastic bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tax would cover the entire rubbish collection budget, and so that element could be taken out of the council budget.&lt;/p&gt;

Thank you to Owen Broadway of Good Energy for responding. His reply to my enquiry is below, and I've made some comments below that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tony,  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks very much for your enquiry. We appreciate the time our customers take in looking at how relevant we are to the ongoing battle against climate change. We also appreciate the opportunity to air our credentials in a public forum such as the one you have provided.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although British Gas has launched 2 new green tariffs; they withdrew their Green Electricity &amp;amp; Climate Aware green tariffs in the spring of 2007 after the National Consumer Council found that they added no additional environmental benefit and were lacking in consumer transparency.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To really look at the efforts British Gas are making we need to look at exactly how the electricity they supply is made. In 2006 just 3% of the electricity British Gas supplied came from renewable sources – less than the government requires them to do, and Centrica, owner of British Gas, is building new power stations that run on coal – the most carbon intensive fossil fuel.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Zero Carbon tariff offers to reduce a household’s carbon emissions to zero - this is being achieved mainly through carbon offset schemes. Although carbon offsetting offers a bridging solution, reducing electricity consumption and replacing the way it is generated are the primary solutions to combating Climate Change.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good Energy supplies 100% renewable electricity NOW; cutting your carbon emissions from your electricity consumption immediately.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true that British Gas’s new Zero Carbon tariff plans to retire Renewable Obligation Certificates above the government obligation. Good Energy has always retired additional ROCs, helping to raise the market price for renewable generators and attracting further investment into the renewables market. This has led to us consistently being recommended by Friends of the Earth, The Good Shopping Guide and Ethical Consumer Magazine.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Good Energy has also always held onto 100% of its Levy Exemption Certificates (LECs) to ensure that the renewable benefits of the electricity supplied are not double counted.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good Energy is unique in the UK because ALL of the electricity we supply comes from renewable sources and is backed by 100% Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin (REGOs), as opposed to one tariff from a company supplying millions of other consumers with fossil fuel created electricity.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this goes some way to answering your questions, if there is anything I can offer more detail on please do not hesitate to give me a call.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regards,  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owen Broadway&lt;br&gt;
Head of&lt;br&gt;
Sales  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's me speaking again. Good Energy are a great company, I've been a happy customer of theirs for years. However I think they've just been out-greened by BG Zero Carbon in the key area of ROCs retirement. My plea to Good Energy is to make the bold move of retiring 100% of their ROCs. I'm aware that this will increase the electricity price hugely, but I for one would pay up, knowing that the electricity was truly green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Owen's points against BG Zero Carbon hits home, and that's the carbon offsetting element. Carbon offsetting is dodgy and I'd rather avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another genuine problem with BG Zero Carbon is that it's only available with dual-fuel. I intend to stop burning fossil fuel gas, and signing up to something that involves burning gas seems a backward step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If British Gas were serious about climate change, they'd stop burning fossil fuels. However, if they come up with the greenest tariff, then it's still the right thing to do to sign up with them despite the rest of the company not being green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary I'll not be switching to BG Zero Carbon for the time being because of their carbon offsetting nonsense and dual fuel racket. However, Good Energy must retire more of their ROCs because they're not as good as BG Zero Carbon on this most important point. I'd also like to see Good Energy publish their ROC retirement percentage prominently on their website (I couldn't find it anywhere).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="co2-footprint"></category></entry><entry><title>Good Energy versus British Gas Zero Carbon</title><link href="/good-energy-versus-british-gas-zero.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-11-10T16:29:00+00:00</published><updated>2007-11-10T16:29:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2007-11-10:/good-energy-versus-british-gas-zero.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Bob at work pointed out an article in the &lt;a href="http://www.endsreport.com/"&gt;Ends Report&lt;/a&gt; that suggests &lt;a href="http://www.britishgas.co.uk/products-and-services/energy/dual/green-energy.html"&gt;British Gas's Zero Carbon&lt;/a&gt; electricity tariff is greener than my &lt;a href="http://www.good-energy.co.uk/"&gt;Good Energy&lt;/a&gt; tariff.

&lt;p&gt;I think the purpose of the book is to highlight the hypocrisy of the
bourgeoisie in their sexual conduct. Published in 1882, the book made me wonder
if the problems that Zola raised have been solved by paternity testing,
contraception and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_support"&gt;child support&lt;/a&gt;.

I've got a Pavlovian reaction to being on the platform, I buy a Bounty bar. This time it took my pound coin and without thinking I lost another £1.10 trying to dislodge the first pound coin. The notice on the machine said not to complain to the station staff if the machine wasn't working, so I complained to the station staff. They said it wasn't anything to do with them (South West Trains). However, they were pretty good about it and put an 'out of order' note on the machine.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that this is a microcosm of the buck passing you see on the railways as a whole. The rail companies should take full responsibility for everything that happens on the railways, from vending machines to accidents. To achieve this, the train operating companies should own Network Rail.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>A Fire Upon the Deep</title><link href="/fire-upon-deep.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-09-13T07:11:00+01:00</published><updated>2007-09-13T07:11:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2007-09-13:/fire-upon-deep.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When Janos lent me Player of Games, he also lent me 'A Fire Upon The Deep' by Vernor Vinge.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're in a mess with global warming, and that's what happens when you leave it to the free market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at all the problems with the NHS, it should be left to the free market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, this indicates a misunderstanding of the idea of free markets. A free market is a way to maximize society's wealth, given the following constraints:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The laws of physics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laws of the land, where society's morals are translated into rules that everyone must follow or be punished.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of laws of the land are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't murder or physically hurt people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't pour mercury into rivers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't steal other people's property.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't sell toys painted with lead paint.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do give 30% of your income above £10,000 to the government.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do give £10 to the government for every kg of CO2 from fossil fuel sources that you emit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone has freedom of speech.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A free markets takes these constraints and gives a system that optimizes society's wealth. Implementing a free market involves extra laws. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any company or individual is free to start up and offer any service anywhere to anyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No cartels for fixing the price of services or labour. In other words, companies or individuals can't get together to fix a price for their services. They must compete on price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No monopolies. A company can't buy up all the other companies providing the same service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the employer-employee relationship, if one party wishes to end the relationship, they can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point that I want to make in this post is that the free market solution that you end up with depends on the laws of the land. There is no single free market solution. For example, if it's against the law to pour mercury into rivers, then your free market solution won't result in rivers polluted with mercury. If it omits the mercury law, then you probably will get mercury pollution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to the quotes at the begining:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We're in a mess with global warming, and that's what happens when you leave it to the free market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd answer that free markets are just a way of solving an optimization problem. If you want the solution to involve reduced CO2 emission, you have to pass a law that makes it more costly to emit CO2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at all the problems with the NHS, it should be left to the free market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This implies that there's a single free market solution to health care. This is wrong. You have to work out a complex system of regulation. Each system of regulation would result in a different outcome. The free market is just a way of maximizing society's wealth given the laws of the land.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="political-manifesto"></category></entry><entry><title>Imprimatur 010</title><link href="/imprimatur-010.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-08-31T11:28:00+01:00</published><updated>2007-08-31T11:28:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2007-08-31:/imprimatur-010.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=145016"&gt;new release&lt;/a&gt; removes the &lt;parameter&gt; element, and replaces it with a &lt;control&gt; element.

Read his idea, then read what I think about it...  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to cut gun crime&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By David Andrews&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present concern about high rates of illegal gun ownership and associated gun crime can be solved very simply in the same way that illegal whiskey distilling was stamped out in Scotland in the late 1700s, by offering huge, for the day, rewards for information leading to the discovery of illegal stills, whereas in Ireland it was merely made illegal where it persists to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the UK police could similarly offer a no questions asked hand-in fee of say £2000 pounds for any person who brings a gun into a police station. At the same time a reward could be offered of twice the hand-in fee ie £4000 for information leading to the prosecution of any person found in the possession or control of an illegal fire arm. And £4000 for each and every weapon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main purposes of holding such illegal weapons is to let others know that you have them, by behaviour and reputation spread by acolytes or fearful potential victims of tacit intimidation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus a little thought will show that the illegal arms user and dealer will have little choice but to throw away, hand in, or not let anyone know they have such weapons, since any holder for the purposes of status or intimidate, will know that he is liable to be grassed up by multiple persons, who will calculate that sooner or later someone else will go to the police, and retribution is likely on all of the many people in the position of victim. May as well be the first to at least take the cash because retribution will be coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the holder decides to keep the possession a secret then their main use – intimidation and status is denied. They will of course still be used for armed robbery but that is a very rare crime and what we are after is to cut street gun culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as he tries to sell a weapon, more than a few times, he risks his customers or those who he has advertised his services to, ( the latter will always be more than the former) picking up a £4000 fee for his trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will not be the case that an industry will develop feeding guns to the police, since they will still retain all their normal investigative rights. Existing and new gun smuggling networks will be rendered extremely dangerous due to the bounty any party could obtain, and of course, whilst guns could be fed to the police by a series of low level associates, the police would simply have to home in on these peoples backgronds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My response to Dave's idea&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the weakness in the idea is the £2,000 paid out if a gun is handed in. It would mean that people would import / manufacture guns for £500, then sell them on to the police with a £1,500 guaranteed profit. The country would soon be awash with guns, and the police would be too poor to do anything about it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By all means have a £4,000 reward for information leading to the successful prosecution of a criminal, but please drop the idea of the police paying out cash for illegal guns.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Car Free</title><link href="/car-free.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-08-26T11:11:00+01:00</published><updated>2007-08-26T11:11:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2007-08-26:/car-free.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hurray!

I agree with Richard Dawkins that the best scientific explanations of the world are superior to god-based supernatural explanations. I begin to diverge from Dawkins when he makes the claim that being an atheist makes you a better person than if you have faith in God. Just because you're right, doesn't make you a better person!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would go as far as saying that being an atheist doesn't necessarily make you any worse than anyone else, but it doesn't necessarily make you any better either.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jehova's witnesses occassionally call at my door. I'm pleased that they do, and we have a conversation about what we believe about the world. I explain that I take religious texts in two parts, physics and morality. The physics part of all religions I've heard of is rubbish. Souls, spirits, virgin births, God etc. are really bad explanations compared to quantum mechanics, evolution etc. The morality part of religions is a mixed bag. I think 'do as you would be done by' is a pretty good idea. A lot of the other stuff is a bit grim though.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="book-review"></category></entry><entry><title>Imprimatur 009</title><link href="/imprimatur-009.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-08-12T15:58:00+01:00</published><updated>2007-08-12T15:58:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2007-08-12:/imprimatur-009.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A new version of &lt;a href="http://imprimatur.wikispaces.com/"&gt;Imprimatur&lt;/a&gt; has been released.

Set around 1987 when I was at school, Clifford Stoll talks about how he single handedly tracked down a hacker in 'The Cuckoo's Egg'. The internet seemed like a new thing and there wasn't a WWW.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stoll paints himself as a long-haired leftish alternative type, wearing an old pair of sneakers (his only pair of shoes) and a beat-up jacket. He's obviously a bit of a know-all. I've met plenty of people like this. What really annoys me is when they talk about recipies for food.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the book is very readable. I felt that it was as much about his lifestyle as the chase. Hunting down the hacker was good too, both aspects of the book complement each other. Stoll doesn't have a car, he cycles everywhere. So do I! It doesn't make me a computer genius, that would be to fall for the Hawking fallacy (not everyone with motor neurone disease is a brilliant theoretical physicist).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: My friend Bill lent me this book (note to Bill: pick it up on Tuesday if you're coming round).

It's cheap and it's easy to install (you just plant it!). However, I made a mistake in that I chose &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_ivy"&gt;Parthenocissus tricuspidata (Boston Ivy)&lt;/a&gt; which isn't an ivy at all but a member of the grape family; meaning that it's deciduous and so not good for insulation in the winter.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So next I bought a real ivy plant, a plant of the genus &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedera"&gt;Hedera&lt;/a&gt;. The shop only had Hedera colchica, so I got that. After a while I did a bit more research, and realized it wouldn't grow tall enough to completely cover the walls of my house!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My research said I needed to buy &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedera_helix"&gt;Hedera helix (Common Ivy)&lt;/a&gt;, which can grow up to 20-30m high. I mentioned it to my Dad, and he said he had plenty. We dug some up and I've just planted it in my garden.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should add that family (except my Dad), friends, professionals (and friends who are professionals) all think I'm mad to grow an ugly, invasive, poisonous weed that will rapidly destroy the fabric of my house while absorbing heavy metals from the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="co2-footprint"></category></entry><entry><title>Patient choice in the NHS</title><link href="/nhs-reform.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-07-05T12:54:00+01:00</published><updated>2007-07-05T12:54:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2007-07-05:/nhs-reform.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I listened to a government spokesman this morning talk about how they were going to improve the NHS by empowering clinicians.

I asked him, 'what's your favourite Banks sci-fi book then?', he said it was Player of Games. I thought I'd read them all, but when he outlined the plot I realized I hadn't. Excellent!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PoG is an excellent book, second only to Use of Weapons in the Banks oevre. There's no tedious navel gazing, no wasted words, the tension is maintained throughout. Brilliant insights into the relationship between humans and other sentient machines. I think the best writing is where the author has a lot to say, and a relatively short space to write it. That isn't to say I'm blindly in favour of short books. As Einstein said about scientific theories, they should be as simple as possible, but no simpler. In fact this maxim also applies to software.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PoG was written in 1989, and as I was reading it I was listening to a Pixies best-of CD, which I remember from the early 90s. I was overcome by a wave of nostalgia for the days of listening to the Pixies at my friend's house while we played snooker (he always won).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I think Banks has played Risk and games like it. They're a feature of his writing, and he writes well about them.

Davies was Lott's main opponent, but no match for him.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In The Seymour Tapes, Lott writes about a bloke who secretly films his family. At one point he had a dilemma in that he saw a misdemeanor by his child, but couldn't confront him with the evidence because that would reveal how he obtained it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is similar to the government's problem with phone tap evidence.

&lt;p&gt;Ages ago in the summer, probably 1992, Steve from Uni invited me out to his parents' house in France. There were two books there that I read, Whitley Strieber's Communion and a book of short stories by Ray Bradbury.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Graveyard For Lunatics is written in a theatrical manner, where all emotion is exagerated, characters are extreme, and events move much faster than in real life. It's set in the 1950s and I think Bradbury is old enough to remember that era. The frenetic, knockabout dialogue doesn't to me have the ring of the 1950s, but what do I know? I'd have said Catcher in the Rye sounded too modern but it was actually written round about then wasn't it?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have one query about the plot. Why didn't they go and see the 'blind' woman who was with the beast at the restaurant straight away?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which reminds me of a plot flaw in 28 Weeks Later. Have you seen that film? It's great! The problem is, when the father comes to see his wife when she is strapped down in the hospital, there is *nobody* guarding her, and no nurses in attendance!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="book-review"></category></entry><entry><title>Corporations are amoral...and that's ok</title><link href="/corporations-are-amoraland-thats-ok.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-06-14T13:05:00+01:00</published><updated>2007-06-14T13:05:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2007-06-14:/corporations-are-amoraland-thats-ok.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I intended to write how corporations are amoral and only concerned with profit, and this isn't a bad thing.

&lt;p&gt;It kept my attention engaged, and there were some genuinely humorous moments. At one point the android is reprimanded by its creator:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'You did nothing You are totally useless. You will dismantle yourself and cease functioning. You cannot even be trusted to collect elementary information about the planet.'  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life requires the use of a car from time to time, and I'd inevitably end up getting lifts from other people and not be able to give them lifts in return. I'd feel bad about that. Yes, I could always hire a car, but that would rule out spur of the moment trips, which is one of the joys of driving.  &lt;/p&gt;

I had a go with Google PageCreator, but it was way too cumbersome and didn't keep a change history.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today most wikis are collaborative, but I predict the rise of the non-collaborative wiki. They will displace many web sites build with the Page Creator model.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm writing this now because I've just changed from &lt;a href="http://www.wikispaces.com/"&gt;Wikispaces&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://www.wetpaint.com/"&gt;Wet Paint&lt;/a&gt;. Wikispaces is great, but you have to pay if you want to use your own domain name. I'm a cheapskate, so I moved to Wet Paint where it's free to use your own domain name. It's worth mentioning that from my point of view the Wet Paint editor is inferior to the one in Wikispaces because one can't control the HTML very well (page fragments in links is one example).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a lot to be said about what should and shouldn't be charged for on a web site.

Strong female characters, theme of betrayal, fascination with aristocracy and wealth, a real understanding of the importance of technology and something I pretentiously call 'intellectual realpolitik'. There's also a plot similarity with 'A Song In Stone'.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Banks matures, there's a sense of him handing down wisdom. This is not unwelcome. He doesn't preach. One of my favourite bits is when the main character compares Sophie to a personal religion. Long live Banks!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="book-review"></category></entry><entry><title>A Dance to the Music of Time: Winter</title><link href="/dance-to-music-of-time-winter.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-05-28T19:59:00+01:00</published><updated>2007-05-28T19:59:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2007-05-28:/dance-to-music-of-time-winter.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Blimp was surprised that I hadn't read 'A Dance to the Music of Time' so I thought I'd give it a go.

The language is sophisticated, and I think I missed a lot of cultural references. Powell sometimes constructs sentences in an odd, contracted manner. The collection I read was the last three books in the series, collectively called 'Winter'. It would probably have been better to start at the beginning, but I was impatient and this was all that the &lt;a href="http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/BathNES/leisureandculture/Libraries/information/batharea.htm#bath"&gt;library&lt;/a&gt; had.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The characters are drawn in a subtle and engaging way. This type of story reminded me of War and Peace, although DMT doesn't have a historical agenda as W&amp;amp;P does. It's entertaining to be drawn into the intrigue and interplay of the characters. The reader is immersed in the flavour of the period and I found myself at times taking on the style of speech in the book. It made me sound pompous and daft.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reckon I'll be looking out for the other books in the series...&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="book-review"></category></entry><entry><title>You're right dammit!

'Come to the &lt;a href="http://www.cafescientifique.org/"&gt;Science Cafe&lt;/a&gt;', he said. That was ages ago, and I've been to every one since (apart from the one on football). Monday saw &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Taverne"&gt;Dick Taverne&lt;/a&gt; talking on the theme of his book, The March of Unreason. He delivered a polemic against the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precautionary_principle"&gt;Precautionary Principle&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The format of the Science Cafe is a half-hour talk, followed by questions. All of the questions were sympathetic to the Baron. He is an accomplished speaker, and his arguments so compelling that nobody was willing to risk ridicule by challenging him. Then an earnest red haired student asked, 'if not the Precautionary Principle, then what should guide policy?'. The Baron answered, 'scientific evidence should guide such decisions'. I asked, 'What do you do in the absence of scientific evidence?', he paused on the horns of a dilemma. If he said, 'you go ahead anyway', then that's obviously reckless, but if he said, 'you don't do anything until the evidence comes in', then that's the Precautionary Principle. In the end he gave a non-answer, waffling.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, I agreed with much of what Dick Taverne had to say. He argued that we should take science seriously, and I totally agree with that. Where he veered off course was when he conflated science and morality.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning: Threat to belief system.&lt;/em&gt; In thinking of the challenges it was possible to make to Taverne, I saw the openings of problems with David Deutsch's ideas in 'The Fabric of Reality', on which I have based my entire world view.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Consultation on draft Climate Change Bill</title><link href="/consultation-on-draft-climate-change.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-05-15T19:54:00+01:00</published><updated>2007-05-15T19:54:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2007-05-15:/consultation-on-draft-climate-change.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Bob sent me a link to the &lt;a href="http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/consult/climatechange-bill/"&gt;consultation on the draft Climate Change Bill&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm concerned that by raising the cost of carbon emissions in the UK, countries with lower emissions costs will come to see their unregulated emissions as a competitive advantage. This would have the overall effect of making global emissions reduction less likely.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if we are going to go ahead with a reduction in emissions then:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the idea of making GHG emissions limits legally binding. It gives the certainty needed for investment, and may lift the issue above short-term party political interference.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I favour the idea of a national carbon levy. The revenue raised by the levy would be divided equally among the population through the income tax system. This would mean that the levy would be tax neutral. The size of the levy would be set annually by a committee with the remit of keeping to the national carbon budget. The committee would work in a similar way to the Monetary Policy Committee.&lt;/p&gt;

On Saturday my friend Bill came up with an argument that made me rethink green electricity.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the UK, thanks to privatization, customers can choose their electricity supplier. This means it's possible to switch to &lt;a href="http://www.greenelectricity.org/"&gt;green electricity&lt;/a&gt;. The question is; what difference does it make if I do?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewables_Obligation"&gt;Renewables Obligation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; electricity supplier in the UK has to buy a certain percentage of renewable electricity (about 7% at the moment I think). Electricity that qualifies as renewable receives Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs). ROCs can be traded separately from the electricity.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill's point was that if you change to a green tariff, it won't cause any more renewable energy to be produced because the electricity demand of people on a green tariff is under 7% of total electricity demand, which is no more than suppliers have to do already by law!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought hard about this and I think he is only right if your green supplier only holds on to the minimum number of ROCS.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way of putting it is that the greenness of electricity is soley determined by whether you retire the ROCs for it, rather than selling them. My electricity supplier, Good Energy, retire some of their ROCs, so I think that my electricity is a bit greener than the 7% national average. I'd like Good Energy to retire all their ROCs. It would cost more but I'd prefer to pay the extra and not contribute to global warming.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can think of two other considerations for how green electricity is. People say to me, 'At peak times, wind turbines can't generate enough electricity and you have to use electricity from fossil fuel sources. Okay, your supplier does offset this with giving other people renewable energy at off-peak times, but it's still not entirely green'. I think this is a minor point compared to the ROCs one, but still I think it is valid. I'd like Good Energy to not do offsetting if possible.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other consideration is non-energy costs. I've been told that only about 60% of an electricity bill goes on the actual electricity, the rest goes on wires, transformers, administration, meter reading etc. What are Good Energy doing to reduce the carbon footprint of this aspect? Perhaps they could have meters that communicate wirelessly, rather than have a person drive around in a van?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I conclude that I was wrong to think that electricity from Good Energy would be completely free from carbon emmissions. However, I was right to switch to them because the associated emmissions are significantly lower than those from a brown electricity supplier. Also, if you try a thought experiment where all electricity is supplied by Good Energy, the UK's electricity would indeed be entirely renewable!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="co2-footprint"></category></entry><entry><title>Vote early, vote often!</title><link href="/vote-early-vote-often.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-05-03T20:58:00+01:00</published><updated>2007-05-03T20:58:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2007-05-03:/vote-early-vote-often.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dear reader, today is election day in Trowbridge.

Apparently he had a rather dissolute lifestyle when he was young, and in the book Utterson looks back on his life and says that he did things that were barely acceptable and nearly did worse.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'The Ex-boyfriend's Handbook' by Matt Dunn is completely different. It's the male equivalent to chick lit. In fact it was on my desk at work and Emily asked why I was reading a girl's book, the cover sort of gives that impression before you look closely. It's a straightforward blokey book, really a feel-good book. Thanks to Irina for recommending it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I've read all of Iain Banks' non-genre books except for Canal Dreams, and I've read all his sci-fi books. I'm so a fan. 'Walking on Glass' was a disturbing read. Banks' books seem to follow a pattern of starting off in an upbeat clever, bounding-along-happily sort of way. This sets you up for a descent into nightmare that doesn't contradict the beginning, it just cleverly reveals it as being part of the horrific whole.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Dean Koontz wrote K-Pax. I've seen that film twice, excellent. Is he an alien? I came to a conclusion after watching it but I can't remember the conclusion. Anyway, I've just read Demon Seed. This is another scary book. It seems to me though that people assume an AI will have a human-like set of motivations. But just because something is intelligent and conscious doesn't mean that it will have the same basic drives and feelings as animals.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm currently reading 'A Dance to the Music of Time'.

The problem with philosophies is that they never seem to be able to encompass everything. It's the equivalent of Godel's incompleteness theorem in maths. I think this is linked to the problem of heirarchies of knowledge. That's why I think Wikipedia has it right in not having a heirarchy of articles in its URL structure. All articles are at the same level. In the same way, David Deutsch says that theories such as quantum mechanics, epistemology, the theory of computation and the theory of evolution don't have a heirarchy, each one can be seen as emergent from the others.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Alasdair Grey is another author I've been meaning to read for ages, ever since I heard about Janine. I was given Poor Things by a friend, and her judgement was excellent as it is a brilliantly written book. It also raised lots of philosophical questions, but don't get me started. I recommend the book.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My aunt gave me Vanilla by Tim Ecott. This book is clearly based on painstaking research, and gives an exhaustive history of vanilla. The history is leavened by anecdotes of his travels on the trail of the plant. In fact, if I was his publisher I'd suggest it would be really interesting to focus on the anecdote part of his writing for his next book.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first Bridget Jones book was awesome. The title of the next book 'The Edge of Reason' led me to think that it might be about her losing her mind. It isn't. It is very funny. I remember Helen Fielding's photo from the first Bridget Jones book, and she looks completely different in the dust jacket photo on this book. Incidentally, the author photo of A Man in Full shows Tom Wolfe in a sort of southern gent outfit.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="book-review"></category></entry><entry><title>A man in full possession of his writing talent</title><link href="/man-in-full-possession-of-his-writing.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-03-25T17:34:00+01:00</published><updated>2007-03-25T17:34:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2007-03-25:/man-in-full-possession-of-his-writing.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A Man in Full is the first Tom Wolfe I've read.

I've always intended to read The Electric Kool Aid Acid Test but never got round to it. Part of what happens in AMIF is that characters get into desparate situations and are then helped by the philosophy of the Stoics, in particular Epictetus.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wolfe has the character Conrad explaining, 'Epictetus said that Zeus has given every person a spark from his own divinity, and no one can take that away from you, not even Zeus, and from that spark comes your character. Everything else is temporary and worthless in the long run, your body included'.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But surely we know that this isn't really how things work. A person's character arises from the particular configuration of the neurons in their brain. Okay, well let's say that Epictetus was using 'divine spark' to mean the human spirit (not a supernatural thing). The bit about nobody being able to take away the 'divine spark' just isn't true. Epictetus obviously hadn't seen One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="book-review"></category></entry><entry><title>Replacement for 50w halogen GU10 lamps</title><link href="/replacement-for-50w-halogen-gu10-lamps.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-03-04T14:27:00+00:00</published><updated>2007-03-04T14:27:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2007-03-04:/replacement-for-50w-halogen-gu10-lamps.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the kitchen, bathroom and sitting room I've got 50w halogen lamps with a GU10 fitting.

Btw, most people say 'bulb', but apparently in the trade they say 'lamp'. I think it's like in the Navy they never say 'boat'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I'm trying to find a low energy replacement. I've bought two lamps from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.yourwelcome.co.uk/acatalog/copy_of_GU10_Low_Energy.html"&gt;http://www.yourwelcome.co.uk/acatalog/copy_of_GU10_Low_Energy.html&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one is the 'GU10 5w Cold Cathode lamp' for 7.99 GBP. This works really well. It comes on straight away and is close to the brightness of the halogen ones. The two drawbacks are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The quality of the light isn't as warm as the halogen (but still not too bad).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's bigger than the halogens and so doesn't fit in some sockets, and those where it does fit, it sticks out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second one I tried is the 'Luxeon LED lamp' at 10.99 GBP. The good things are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It looks really good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's exactly the same size and shape of the halogen lamps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It only uses 1W (yes, 1W!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bad points are that it isn't very bright, and the quality of the light is slightly odd. My Dad called it 'ghostly'. It's very white with a very slight greenish tinge (to my eyes anyway).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="co2-footprint"></category></entry><entry><title>New The-Elected.com</title><link href="/new-electedcom.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-02-18T23:06:00+00:00</published><updated>2007-02-18T23:06:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2007-02-18:/new-electedcom.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The-Elected.com is completely different now:  &lt;/p&gt;

These terms are usually used when talking about electronics, but they needn't be.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think of digital as being where a range of values correspond to another discrete value. In his book, The Digital River, Richard Dawkins says that DNA is digital. That's because even if you bend and twist the DNA around a bit, the order of the proteins stays the same, and it's the order that counts. When the DNA is copied, the copy isn't nearly the same like a photocopy, the information in the copied DNA is &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the same, like a copied computer file.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that speech and writing is digital too. When I've played &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_(game)"&gt;Chinese whispers&lt;/a&gt;, it's been disappointing because the phrase never changes. If one were to play Chinese pictures (I'm sure there is such a game) with art that didn't contain symbols, the change would be immediate.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because with speech, a large variety of sounds map to a single word. It is digital. Also with writing, a large variety of marks on paper map to a single letter. It too is digital.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>I think my boiler's getting furred up because I ca...</title><link href="/post-1422241612816212501.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-01-25T20:57:00+00:00</published><updated>2007-01-25T20:57:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Tony Locke</name></author><id>tag:None,2007-01-25:/post-1422241612816212501.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I think my boiler's getting furred up because I can hear fragments of limescale move around when I turn the central heating on.

I haven't, because I don't have the time, money or skill. In fact, it's such a huge undertaking that no single person can fully investigate it on her own.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CO~2~ emissions.&lt;/strong&gt; Many people attempt to buy food that has caused the minimum CO2 pollution. But as the article points out, this is incredibly difficult. I buy groceries from an organic box scheme that doesn't allow air freight. The best solution though is to have a &lt;a href="http://www.tlocke.org.uk/co2-tax-back"&gt;carbon dioxide tax&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health of the person eating the food.&lt;/strong&gt; Here it seems that organic labelling does its job. With organic, you're eating food that's been tried and tested for thousands of years. Where's the benefit to the consumer in ingesting novel chemical compounds?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
