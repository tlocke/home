It means we will never make any progress.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year  &lt;/p&gt;

The elephant in the room is the stranglehold corporations, mainly US have on all democratic governments.&lt;br&gt;
Lets talk about that.&lt;br&gt;
After all, it …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">generator</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 31 Dec 2007 10:16:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:None,2007-12-31:/post-5730770842585017136.html</guid></item><item><title>Tony - you say there is a danger of governments be...</title><link>/post-4829669644469690590.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Tony - you say there is a danger of governments being bought&amp;gt; where have you been the last 35 years?

&lt;p&gt;A further point is that in free markets the people who hold all the capital will basically manipulate investments to make them ever wealthier, including buying government policies as per US.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free market advocates tend to use the imaginary non …&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">generator</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 30 Dec 2007 20:16:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:None,2007-12-30:/post-8272140971636763789.html</guid></item><item><title>The point is that there arent free markets anywher...</title><link>/post-2342336993019991547.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The point is that there arent free markets anywhere - people who advocate them ignore the fact that they never will be.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU still prevents poor African countires form exporting produce to us by using tarrfs - ditto the americans who hugely subsidiase grain.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony is wrong to think that the police buying the guns would lead to people making and selling them to the police.  &lt;/p&gt;
