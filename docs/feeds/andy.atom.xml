It's a moral conundrum with an obvious solution:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone hurts someone you love you would willingly, even actively, kill them. This would be an understandable action, but not a justifiable one. The police would be right to try and stop you from killing and to punish you if you had killed. This doesn't make the moral issue of murder muddier, it stays the same - it is wrong.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly with torture. If the unlikely scenario of the ticking bomb/kidnapped child should ever occur, then the person in a position to extract information should do so in the knowlesge that they will face the same punishment as if it were an 'unjustified' act. If they are convinced enough that they will save America, or the Suffocating Kidnapee, then they should be willing to make that sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>After reading the Wikipedia intro I immediately th...</title><link href="/post-3237010274514596477.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-10-01T00:06:00+01:00</published><updated>2008-10-01T00:06:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Andy</name></author><id>tag:None,2008-10-01:/post-3237010274514596477.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;After reading the Wikipedia intro I immediately thought in terms of 1s and 0s and that made me think of Fuzzy Logic.

&lt;p&gt;A bit like the pre-crime department in Minority Report, DNA is foolproof unless someone tampers with the evidence. What it does is absolves the police of ever having to do any real work because once they have DNA the case is sewn up tight. We must be very wary of tools that the government can easily use for oppression.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and CCTV is to protect property, not people. I used to live in a flat in town and someone was murdered outside my doorway one night. Nobody has ever been convicted despite it being one of the most heavily surveyed parts of the city.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>There are various reasons why charging for parking...</title><link href="/post-4687984748708360018.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-03-10T08:50:00+00:00</published><updated>2008-03-10T08:50:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Andy</name></author><id>tag:None,2008-03-10:/post-4687984748708360018.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are various reasons why charging for parking at hospitals is a bad thing.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;finding that you don't have any change  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the only parking space is 10 minutes walk away from the entrace (no handy trolleys to like at the airport!)  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the birth takes 18 hours, you come out to find your car towed/clamped and have to deal with getting it back before you have to pick her and the baby up.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You say that poor people don't drive, but they certainly get people to drive them to visit people at the hospital. them and the elderly. how nice for the person ferrying the visitor to have to pick up the tab for parking to add to their good deed!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are dozens of better ways to generate revenue than parking and they should all be kept away from the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>nice to see i'm not the only one fighting against ...</title><link href="/post-277876908709833227.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-02-02T20:33:00+00:00</published><updated>2008-02-02T20:33:00+00:00</updated><author><name>andy</name></author><id>tag:None,2008-02-02:/post-277876908709833227.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;nice to see i'm not the only one fighting against tony's determination to free the world's trade!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;free trade is a good idea(l) but impossible to achieve and - like communism - not neccessarily a good idea to attempt.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;corporations act in their own best interest and governments (are supposed to) work in our best interest. therefore, you will always get conflict between free markets and legislative governing.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what we need is govenment that is not paid for by business and not afraid to upset us (ie. the opposite of what we have now). this is the first stage.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the second stage is to understand the effects of what the markets are doing (ie. starving the Irish) and whether legislation needs to be bought in to counteract that and, if that happens, what the consequences will be.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>one of the most memorable parts of eating at the F...</title><link href="/post-431697676892351124.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-02-02T18:24:00+00:00</published><updated>2008-02-02T18:24:00+00:00</updated><author><name>andy</name></author><id>tag:None,2008-02-02:/post-431697676892351124.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;one of the most memorable parts of eating at the Fat Duck was a red cabbage gazpacho with a spoon of mustard ice cream in the middle. not quite sure what the difference between 'cabbage water' and 'cabbage gazpacho' is, but having tried both i can definitely tell you that …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;one of the most memorable parts of eating at the Fat Duck was a red cabbage gazpacho with a spoon of mustard ice cream in the middle. not quite sure what the difference between 'cabbage water' and 'cabbage gazpacho' is, but having tried both i can definitely tell you that there is a difference!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Subsidies or not...

&lt;p&gt;And I didn't say we shouldn't bail out private companies - just that we should be aware of the consequences of privatisation. If Northern Rock hadn't been bailed out large parts of the north of England's population would have lost both their savings and their homes. If Railtrack hadn't been bailed out the railways would only be used by wildlife now. Both unthinkable, but a logical conclusion to 'leaving things to the market'.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>I don't know anything about a straw man but it was...</title><link href="/post-2497078339830723053.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-09-22T22:21:00+01:00</published><updated>2007-09-22T22:21:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Andy</name></author><id>tag:None,2007-09-22:/post-2497078339830723053.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don't know anything about a straw man but it was certainly a false syllogism 'Will people drive electric cars?'+'A C5 is an electric car'='People in the future will drive C5s'.
