Have you not noticed that in the US which is the benchmark democracy and which is pushing its dogmatic fee trade policy on the rest of us, is governed entirely by the whims of big business. Each presidential candidate, indeed any candidate has to raise huge amounts of money, and this money is given in return for explicit policy promises.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>May I say I totally agree with your previous corre...</title><link href="/post-8272140971636763789.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2007-12-30T20:16:00+00:00</published><updated>2007-12-30T20:16:00+00:00</updated><author><name>generator</name></author><id>tag:None,2007-12-30:/post-8272140971636763789.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;May I say I totally agree with your previous correspondent.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone making a gun, which is hard to do in secret, can't be out robbing old ladies.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People trading guns, by definition are not in secret, and anyone in the chain knows that they can get more cash by grassing the sellers or dealers up than taking it to the police.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
