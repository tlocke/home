<p>" Similarly, Good Energy has also always held onto 100% of its Levy<br>
Exemption Certificates (LECs) to ensure that the renewable benefits of<br>
the electricity supplied are not double counted."  </p>

<p>Yes, I thought so …</p>

            <p>Good Energy used to be the clear leader in green electricity in the UK. Now I get the feeling that this space is beginning to get competitive. Here's what I'd do if I were Good Energy and wanted to jump ahead of the crowd again.  </p>

            <p>I set out to port <a href="http://www.own-id.com/">Own-Id</a> to <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a> but failed because Own-Id relies on people being able to point their own host name to the Own-Id app. This only works because Own-Id has its own IP address.

            <p>This is a list of things that I'd do to pay for the reduction in taxes. Then with more money in their pocket, people could pay the higher food prices.</p>

            <p>A fine summer's evening meant a low turnout at the Raven on Monday evening, as the stalwarts gathered for the Science Cafe.  </p>
<p>What sticks in my mind from the talk is the fact that CO2 emissions are proportional to the weight of the car, and inversely proportional to engine efficiency …</p>

            <p>Somehow I already knew the basic idea behind Ender's Game. The idea reached me by word of mouth; I was infected by the meme! Then one day I was discussing the meme with Janos, who knew the book and lent it to me.  </p>

            <p>Moving, emotional, satisfying. I particularly like taking ideas seriously, and this film does that with the protagonist's outwardly odd behaviour. I know I always refer back to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:The_Fabric_of_Reality">The Fabric of Reality</a>, but Lars acts as if he's applying the approach of David Deutsch. I'll explain. Lars' mind has come up …</p>
