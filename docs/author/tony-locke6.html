            <p>Bath and North East Somerset council is conducting a <a href="http://www.bathnes.gov.uk/transportandstreets/Parking/pages/default.aspx">survey on car parking</a>. Here's my comment at the end:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would like to see more pedestrianization of Bath. In particular the route for pedestrians from Oldfield Park to the city centre should be improved with more zebra crossings and paths …</p></blockquote>

            <p>Regarding the title, that's not junk in the Ke\$ha sense. I think it was on Tuesday 23rd April that the contents of my garage in Trowbridge was moved to Bath by Me &amp; My Van. The tenants had moved in the previous day, and so the removal of the contents …</p>

            <p>I've made a brief response to the <a href="http://consultation.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/openstandards/">UK Cabinet Office open standards consultation</a>. The first question asks:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>How does this definition of open standard compare to your view of what makes a standard 'open'?</p>

<p>My reply is:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a good definition, but a shortcoming is the alternative to RF …</p></blockquote>

            <p>Some time ago, while visiting Matt in Oxford, we came back from his PhD celebrations and sat in his kitchen for a bit. One of his housemates was there and talked about Charles Dickens. I opined that Dickens was sentimental, melodramatic and at times lurid. She recommended Anthony Trollope. I …</p>
