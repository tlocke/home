getting a chance to ask my question. This time at the Science Cafe, mine was
the <em>first</em> question: 'What do you make of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox">Fermi Paradox</a>?'. The speaker's answer was that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox#Communication_is_impossible_due_to_problems_of_scale">there are other civilizations, but they're all too far away …</a></p>

            <p>I'm trying to understand <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversible_computing">reversible computing</a>. My friend Bill made the comment that it may well be of interest to academics, but it has no appreciable effect in the real world. So here's a rough calculation for the power an irreversible computer needs that's operating right at the Landauer limit …</p>

<a href="/two-rate-electricity-meter.html">my question</a> about a two rate meter. I can have one for free if I commit to staying with Good Energy for at least two years.

Maybe I've not looked hard enough, but I couldn't find any info about the election on the <a href="http://www.trowbridge.gov.uk/viewcontent.asp?id=137">Town Council website</a>.

            <p>Thanks for your encouragement. I'm going through the council because I assume that they'll take care of the legal / financial bits.  </p>
<p>They don't seem terribly keen on my small 38m2 back garden though! I may well take up your suggestion of putting a notice up.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hello, my friend has a day/night meter and gets cheap electricity at night. I've just got a single rate meter and so can't take advantage of the cheap electricity. I'm an existing Good Energy customer. What are my options?</p>
