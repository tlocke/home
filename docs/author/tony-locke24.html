            <p>The train company wasn't greedy enough. They could have made quite a bit of money if they'd have added another couple of carriages.  </p>
<p>The problem is that there's no competition. If there had been, then a more commercially aware company would have taken their customers.  </p>

            <p>Well, I'd read Sophie's World and Sophie's Choice. I picked up Jostein Gaarder's Through A Glass, Darkly and was enraged by the smug Christianity of it all. I don't like the fantasy genre, but give me the Chronicles of Thomas Covenant Unbeliever over nauseating angels. The whole book is drearily …</p>

            <p>My house was built with a room in the loft. On either side of the room there's a low wall (dwarf wall is the technical term). This forms voids with triangular cross-section that I've filled with insulation.  </p>
