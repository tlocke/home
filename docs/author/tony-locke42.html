            <p>I've just listened to David King saying that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7603257.stm">we should switch our research funding</a> away from fundamental research and direct it towards the practical problems we face, such as climate change, population growth and AIDS in poor countries.  </p>

            <p>At my aunt's house during Christmas 2000, not long after my mum died, I started to read l'Etranger. I never finished it, and I keep meaning to come back to it. It was different from anything I had read before, and I found that it both shocked and appealed to …</p>

            <p>My mum always used to read Joanna Trollope. They were always lying about the house. I remember reading The Rector's Wife. Also, during my mum's illness I read another one whose title I've forgotten (was it Other People's Children?).  </p>

<p>The later chapters of Dennet's book were more convincing than the first chapters, but the book was interesting all the way through. Dennet tried to convince me that even in a deterministic universe, things can be avoided, and …</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hello,  </p>
<p>In France, jars of chocolate spread, mustard etc, are often designed so that you can re-use them as drinking-glasses when the contents are used up.  </p>
<p>This seems like a good idea, so I was wondering why we don't take this approach …</p></blockquote>

It seems like Radio 1 have done a deal with Bebo; Grim Dog is promoting links to Bebo on the R1 site.</p>
