            <p>I'm a member of Greenpeace. Have been since my teens. They've just sent me an email on energy policy in which they say call for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feed-in_Tariff">Feed-in Tariff (FIT)</a>. Bad idea, and here's why.  </p>

            <p>2001: A Space Odyssey is one of those films you know a lot about before seeing it. Some would say, 'it carries a weight of expectation'. Well, one thing I can certainly say is that afterwards you really feel you've seen a *proper* film. I expect that Lawrence of Arabia …</p>

            <p>I heard someone on the radio advocating road pricing. I'm in favour of this, so I've added an <a href="http://www.tlocke.org.uk/page/16">article on road pricing</a> to the <a href="http://www.tlocke.org.uk/page/0">Political Manifesto</a>. My twist is that the money should go to maintenance of the road network, and any left over should be divided up equally between …</p>

            <p>The UK government has given permission for companies to build nuclear power stations. The government say that they will not be subsidised by the taxpayer. As long as they really aren't subsidised (including insurance) then that's okay with me, and I'll explain why.  </p>

            <p>An excellent film that brought up all sorts of moral questions. Boringly, the solution to the problem of conflict diamonds is good regulation. Since the diamond trade is international, it covers many jurisdictions and this makes regulation more difficult. So the meta solution is supra-national political entities such as the …</p>

            <p>The Illearth War, the second book after <a href="/2008/lord-fouls-bane.html">Lord Foul's Bane</a> is a bit more violent, but Covenent continues his tortured existence.

There's no single big change, just an accumulation of small things. At the suggestion of John Murray I've <a href="http://www.own-id.com/faq/">changed the 'about' page to a FAQ</a>. Let me know what you think.  </p>
<p>Own-Id fact: there are now 88 OpenIds on Own-Id.</p>
