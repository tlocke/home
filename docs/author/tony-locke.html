            <p>I seem to remember that these two quotes are from Daniel Ingram:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If there's one thing guaranteed to make the heart sink it's someone saying to you,
'Let me tell you about my spiritual journey...'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are all sorts of good ways of learning the dharma: books, teachers etc. the
  only one I wouldn't recommend is the internet.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, let me tell you about my spiritual journey, which takes the form of internet links.</p>

<p>In the final days of 2020 I experienced a
<a href="https://ronyabanks.com/the-meditators-dark-night-of-the-soul/">Dark Night Of The Soul</a>: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spiritual seekers, beware! The path to enlightenment can be both rewarding and
treacherous. Many great spiritual seekers throughout time have described how their
spiritual practices underwent a period laden with darkness, despair, fear, anxiety,
depression, and hopelessness. This concept was originally coined the “Dark Night of
the Soul” by St John of the Cross, a Spanish poet and priest in the 1500’s.
References to the Dark Night can also be found in Buddhist, Kundalini, Pagan/Occult,
Christian, Jewish, and Islamic literature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As <a href="https://www.wakeupcloud.com/dark-night-of-the-soul/">Henri Juntilla puts it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All I could do was stumble forward. I didn’t know what was going on. I didn’t know if
I was going to survive. I didn’t know anything. I had no comfort. All I did, and all
I could do, was put one foot in front of the other, and wander forward in the dark.
Be kind to yourself during this time. Just do your best. That is enough.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Shinzen Young" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/whnGgq4O3jM/hqdefault.jpg"></p>
<p>Ingram says that the dharma can be presented in many different ways, each appealing to
a different 'aesthetic' preference in the reader or listener. I found that Shinzen Young
'spoke my language'. Here's clip of Shinzen answering the question, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ptkH0uK1uXM">'After enlightenment, what's left, what's the point?'</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Mastering The Core Teachings Of The Buddha" src="https://www.mctb.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/BookCoverSM.jpg"></p>
<p>I've quoted him in anticipation of finally coming to Daniel Ingram's book
<a href="https://www.mctb.org/">Mastering The Core Teachings Of The Buddha</a>, which was pivotal
in my understanding of the dharma. There are many points where I now don't necessarily
agree with Ingram, but the book does an excellent job of setting out a clear and
coherent position.</p>
<p><img alt="Mahasi Sayadaw" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mahasi_Sayadaw.jpg/174px-Mahasi_Sayadaw.jpg"></p>
<p>I became very taken with the <a href="https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/mahasi/wheel370.html">Satipatthana Vipassana</a> by Mahasi Sayadaw. Written in the 1950s it describes
something of an enlightenment bootcamp where people would come to practice the the
technique of 'noticing'. He writes at the end:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Impermanence, suffering and non-self will be realized through direct personal
experience, and with the full development of these knowledges, Nibbana will be
realized. It will not take long to achieve the objective, possibly one month, or
twenty days, or fifteen days, or, on rare occasions, even in seven days for those
select few with extraordinary parami.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not for the faint hearted though:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the hard struggle, one may be reduced to a mere skeleton of skin, bones and
sinews when one's flesh and blood wither and dry up, but one should not give up one's
efforts so long as one has not attained whatever is attainable by manly perseverance,
energy and endeavor." These instructions should be followed with a strong
determination. It may be possible to keep awake if there is strong enough
concentration to beat off sleep, but one will fall asleep if sleep gets the upper
hand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Shargrol" src="http://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/custom-icon-design/silky-line-user/512/user-2-icon.png"></p>
<p>The person that I currently find myself most closely in agreement with is a
mysterious person on the internet who goes by the name of Shargrol. Here Shargrol talks
about stream entry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is entirely possible. Try to feel that in your bones. If you don't think it's
possible, then of course it won't happen. But "nothing" is always here, always right
within the gap of individual sensations. It doesn't take much to settle down,
minimize effort, let reality and awareness just be as it is, dwell in equanimity, let
equanimity get loose and dreamy, let the distinction between observer and observed
get blurry... and then drop into nibbana. Very simple, just give yourself the
opportunity for it to happen by consistent practice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shargrol's thoughts come to us as posts to various websites scattered throughout the
web. Thankfully his writings have been collected in
<a href="https://shargrolpostscompilation.blogspot.com/p/blog-page.html">A Compilation Of Shargrol's Posts</a></p>
<p>Finally, I'm currently reading
<a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Dark_Night_of_the_Soul_(Peers_translation)">A Dark Night Of The Soul</a> by John Of The Cross.</p>
