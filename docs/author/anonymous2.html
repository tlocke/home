            <p>Have done already. Did it about a month ago, when my previous bill arrived with its half a tree of promotional guff. That's how I know they are dragging their heels!</p>

<p>I rate Stross very highly as his what-if's and settings are wonderfully creative, while his writing style is often darkly humorous - a fun approach in a genre that often tends towards overly serious tones.  </p>
<p>If you liked Wireless you should definitely check out some of his …</p>

            <p>Your absolutely right, price goes up, people buy less. But its not linear, and its bounded. If I were an economist I could explain better, I think its called elasticity of supply. Actually with energy its probably in-elasticity of supply.  </p>

            <p>Your right, it does seem that Opera Mobile supports the command. Opera Mini, that I was using, does not.  </p>
