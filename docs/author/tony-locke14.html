            <p>I was on the brink of doing architecture at uni, but I switched to physics at the last minute because I was more interested in it. A lot of the books I read were on physics, and almost none on architecture, so I realized that physics was where my true …</p>

            <p>Actually that's my error message! It means that the browser is a bit old fashioned and doesn't support the Geolocation API. Odd because I thought you had the same Android version as me. Probably yet another way in which your phone manufacturer has ruined Android!</p>

Finished reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herland_%28novel%29">Herland</a>, by Charlotte Perkins Gilman. Herland is a feminist utopia, an undiscovered realm populated entirely by women. It's easy to mock utopias, but they're much harder to write about than dystopias, so I admire anyone who has …</p>

            <p>Alastair Reynolds is a consistently fine writer. I've recently finished Zima Blue, a book of Reynolds' short stories, and every one has been superb. Reynolds is becoming one of my most highly rated sci-fi authors. I've lent the book to Bob at work, who's a sci-fi fan, he's sure to …</p>
