            <p>The bailing out of Northern Rock was a misuse of taxpayer's money. The FSA aleady guarantees the first £2,000 and then 90% up to £33,000 of any deposits. The further guarantees that the bank was making just makes it more likely that banks will be even more reckless …</p>

            <p>Well, UK trains are among the cheapest in Europe if you include subsidies.  </p>
<p>But the main thing is that privatization only works if it's done well. I think UK rail was botched, so we're not really seeing all the benefit we could.  </p>

            <p>Yes, that's true, nationalizing it would put an end to buck passing. The problem is that it would also put an end to competition, and competition drives standards up and prices down. It also puts the government in the nice position of being able to regulate the industry without having …</p>

            <p>When Janos lent me Player of Games, he also lent me 'A Fire Upon The Deep' by Vernor Vinge. Janos is like Amazon Recommends! Vernor's book is good, very imaginative. One problem with the book is that it hasn't been properly proofread. Really, all books should be written as wikis …</p>

            <p>What's the difference between a nanobot and a virus? The answer from the Science Cafe talk at the Raven on Monday is that a virus is biological and a nanobot artificial. So I take this to mean there's no intrinsic difference, it's just how they come into being. This has …</p>

            <p>Often people use the phrase 'leave it to the free market'. This applies whether or not they are in favour of free markets. For example:  </p>
<ul>
<li>We're in a mess with global warming, and that's what happens when you leave it to the free market.</li>
<li>Look at all the problems with …</li></ul>
