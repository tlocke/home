              <p>I'd heard lots of talk about Ayn Rand, and I'd already read Anthem online, so I ordered Fountainhead from Bath Central Library using their online reservation system. The system worked really well. Ultimately of course, books will be like music, where you just download it. Hopefully books will be licensed …</p>

              <p>On Thursday there's a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiltshire#Politics_and_administration">Wiltshire County Council</a> by-election for my ward, Trowbridge East. I've done a little table to help me decide who to vote for. Don't rely on this table for your own information, look at the primary sources.</p>
