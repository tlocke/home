            <p>one of the most memorable parts of eating at the Fat Duck was a red cabbage gazpacho with a spoon of mustard ice cream in the middle. not quite sure what the difference between 'cabbage water' and 'cabbage gazpacho' is, but having tried both i can definitely tell you that …</p>

            <p>Subsidies or not... My friend just spent a week travelling from country to country by train in Eastern Europe and the most he paid for a ticket was £12 - from Belgrade to Zagreb. Capital to capital within the UK would be almost ten times that!  </p>

            <p>I don't know anything about a straw man but it was certainly a false syllogism 'Will people drive electric cars?'+'A C5 is an electric car'='People in the future will drive C5s'. Knob.</p>

            <p>"drives standards up and prices down"! That hasn't worked very well, has it?  </p>
<p>I like your idea about government leaving private enterprise to it, but what happens when it's just not up to the job? Do you bail it out with public money - like with Railtrack and Northern Rock?</p>

            <p>I think "abandon hope" would be a more apt title. Anyone who can't see the moral vacuum that any company peddling these type of technologys is blind. any government not legislating against them is derelicting their duties. it wraps up everything bad ablut the modern world into one neat pachage …</p>
