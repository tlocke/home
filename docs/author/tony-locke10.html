            <p>Here's a conversation I'm having with my bank, <a href="http://www.smile.co.uk/">Smile</a>. Since it doesn't show them at their best, I thought I'd preface the thread by saying that Smile are an excellent bank in general. Their customer service is usually very good, and even in this instance everyone's polite and doing their …</p>

            <p>In Macleod's book, the Execution Channel is a TV channel that shows judicial executions in real time. The idea is that the Chinese write most of the software in the world, including surveillance cameras for prisons. They include code that sends a copy of what's recorded back to a TV …</p>

            <p>I've noticed the phrase 'fuel poverty' being used. I find this phrase infuriating because it implies that someone could be wealthy in every way apart from fuel, which is absurd (assuming we're talking about the UK in the present day). It also implies that someone could be in poverty in …</p>

            <p>Greece should not be bailed out, not by the EU or by the IMF. If it's bailed out, it will have its policies dictated to it by the IMF, which will cause huge resentment. A bailout will also reward financial recklessness, because other countries will think that they can spend …</p>
