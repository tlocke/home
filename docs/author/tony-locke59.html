            <p>Just recently my friend Zoe was moving house and she had a stack of books that people
could take, as she was going to throw them away. I took
<a href="/2007/watcher.html">The Watcher</a> and Nick Hornby's About A Boy. I saw the film
ages ago and liked it. I like the book …</p>

            <p>Emily sent me <a href="http://environment.independent.co.uk/lifestyle/article2666422.ece">an article on GM crops</a> which at first plunged me into confusion. I find the whole GM thing very complicated and hard to think about. Then it struck me that the whole situation would be simplified and improved if the idea of patents were abolished.  </p>

            <p>I found out that Janos was a fan of Iain Banks. I asked him, 'what's your favourite Banks sci-fi book then?', he said it was Player of Games. I thought I'd read them all, but when he outlined the plot I realized I hadn't. Excellent!  </p>

            <p>You'd have thought so, but since March 2005, the UK government can issue a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6268959.stm">Control Order</a>. This means you're effectively punished without a trial. I think this is wrong.</p>

            <p>I saw Tim Lott on tv once, he was taking part in a discussion on one of those arts review programmes. He dominated the argument, talking forcefully, almost agressively. Armando Iannucci was there (seemed a bit unsure of himself) and also Andrew Davies. Davies was Lott's main opponent, but no …</p>

            <p>I fancied reading one of Malcolm Bradbury's campus novels, but what caught my eye in Bath Central Library was Ray Bradbury's A Graveyard For Lunatics.  </p>
<p>Ages ago in the summer, probably 1992, Steve from Uni invited me out to his parents' house in France. There were two books there that …</p>

            <p>I intended to write how corporations are amoral and only concerned with profit, and this isn't a bad thing. Corporations are best seen as a force of nature like the sea. We rightly compel corporations to follow laws, and it's the laws that convey our morality, and the laws that …</p>

            <p>I've long been annoyed at how bad public transport is, and I've long been mulling over an idea to make it actually work. I've put up an <strong><a href="http://www.tlocke.org.uk/page/6">article called Public Transport 2.0</a></strong> explaining the idea. Let me know what you think.</p>
