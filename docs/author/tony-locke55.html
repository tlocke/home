              <p>I always look forward to Willem Buiter's posts, and his latest, <a href="http://maverecon.blogspot.com/2007/10/capital-gains-tax.html">on a common tax rate on all forms of capital income</a> is absolutely spot on. In fact I've added it to <a href="http://www.tlocke.org.uk/page/11">my manifesto</a>.  </p>
