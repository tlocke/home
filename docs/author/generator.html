            <p>Tony, no disrespect to you, but I think you find it very difficult to question the difficulties of the system we live under, and use abstract unreal concepts like "free trade" " democracy" etc to avoid actually recognising and talking about them. It means we will never make any progress.<br>
All the very best,<br>
your chum, generarator</p>

            <p>Personally, I think that agreeeing to agree on State funding is cop out - ie one doesn't have to worry any more about the elephant in the room.<br>
The elephant in the room is the stranglehold corporations, mainly US have on all democratic governments.<br>
Lets talk about that.<br>

            <p>May I say I totally agree with your previous correspondent.  </p>
<p>A further point is that in free markets the people who hold all the capital will basically manipulate investments to make them ever wealthier, including buying government policies as per US.  </p>

            <p>The point is that there arent free markets anywhere - people who advocate them ignore the fact that they never will be.  </p>
<p>The EU still prevents poor African countires form exporting produce to us by using tarrfs - ditto the americans who hugely subsidiase grain.  </p>
