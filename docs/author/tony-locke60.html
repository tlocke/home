            <p>Andy left a comment on <a href="/eu-holocaust-denial-ban.html">EU holocaust denial ban</a>, that really posed the question: what, if any, are the limits of free speech? I remembered an <a href="">interview with Noam Chomsky</a> where he said:  </p>

            <p>The short answer to your first question is yes. However, since cars wear out, the increased CO2 emissions are only temporary. My giving up driving is the green bit, and selling the car gives me a financial reward at the cost of some CO2 emissions. So it's mixed but the …</p>

            <p>My friend Zoe moved house recently, and was offering people books that otherwise would be thrown out. One of the books I took was 'The Watcher' by Jane Palmer. I think I'm probably missing the point somewhat, but it read like a children's book. Not that that's a bad thing …</p>

            <p>It seems a good idea to store your bookmarks on the web, then you always have them with you, whatever computer you're on. I had a look at bookmarking websites some time ago, and for some reason decided they weren't that good. Sarah at work got me thinking about them …</p>

            <p>One of the tiresome things about the web is remembering so many different usernames and passwords, and having to enter them all the time. Today I just signed up for an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID">OpenId</a> with <a href="https://www.myopenid.com/">MyOpenId.com</a>. It'll mean that for participating web sites I'll only have to sign in once. Great …</p>

            <p>Thanks to Emily and Bob for pointing out an
<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/lifestyle/article2579329.ece">article</a>
in the Independent about green electricity that's relevant to my
<a href="/was-i-right-to-change-to-good-energy.html">post about Good Energy</a>.
The article seems to support the view that the extra greenness that Good Energy gives is the retired ROCs.</p>
