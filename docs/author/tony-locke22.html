            <p>I've just finished watching the Paxman interview with Nick Clegg. Actually, Clegg did better than I thought he would. I was disappointed that the £10,000 income tax threshold wouldn't apply to everyone; if you're earning over £100,000 then it disappears apparently. I'm not earning anywhere near that, but …</p>

            <p>I've been trying to get a scarf like this for ages. I've subsequently been told me that a black weave means you're a supporter of Hamas. Well I'm certainly not that; I think they should stop their rocket attacks on Israel immediately. Of course, Israel should also end its illegal …</p>

            <p>The Conservatives want to give a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/apr/10/conservatives-marriage-tax-break-analysis">cash reward for being married</a>. I think they're utterly wrong, and that <a href="http://www.polifesto.com/policies/23/">marriage should be disestablished</a>.</p>
<p>The syllogism that the Tories trot out is that married couples are good for society, so if we pay people to get married there will be more married …</p>

            <p>Following <a href="/trevor-carbin-responds.html">our debate</a>, I've received further comments from Trevor Carbin. He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rather than go over the specifics yet again I'll look at the general argument. Your viewpoint seems to be that government should not intervene and should let markets look after themselves, with regulators regulating where necessary.  </p>
