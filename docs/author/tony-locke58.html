                <p>I previously wrote on the wiki about how it's a good idea to grow climbing plants on the walls of your house because the shade and insulation keep the house cool in summer and warm in winter. It's cheap and it's easy to install (you just plant it!). However, I …</p>

                <p>I listened to a government spokesman this morning talk about how they were going to improve the NHS by empowering clinicians. This is no doubt a good idea, but I believe that what increases quality is giving users choice, and therefore competition between providers.  </p>
