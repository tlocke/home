            <p>This is the box with all my old physics stuff in. A lot of wonderful books that I never properly understood. I wish I could spend some more time understanding it. I wasn't very good at physics, but could understand enough to find it interesting.  </p>

            <p>Here's another photo of the skip, taken on 20th of July. I've contacted the BANES Council about it, but they've said they can't do anything about it because it's on private land. I've asked them about planning permission, as it's permanently there. I'll let you know their reply.  </p>

            <p>When I moved to Bath I tried for ages to get TalkTalk to transfer their broadband to the new house. They were terrible, and just couldn't do it, so I moved to BT, who were excellent. Bill recently asked how much BT costs. I'm with the 10 GB per month …</p>

            <p>I was walking along the pavement, and someone was wheeling a bicycle in the opposite direction. I stepped onto the road so that we could pass, and he thanked me.  </p>
<p>I wondered if he had applied Kant's test that if everybody rode bikes to work, would things work out okay …</p>
