            <p>I've been moved to write the following to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westbury_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29">my MP</a> and some of my MEPs:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Andrew Murrison, Graham Watson, Neil Parish,  </p>
<p>I was concerned to hear that the Court of Appeal has ruled that patents should be allowed on software.  </p>

            <p>Some time ago I started reading a Wendy Perriam. 'The 50 minute hour ' I think it was called. I found I just couldn't get into it. Perriam was an author I remember my mum reading, so I thought I'd give her another go with Lying. I believe that Perriam has …</p>

            <p>Toby asked what I thought of a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/rogerbootle/3043978/Financial-Crisis-How-we-have-learned-the-limits-to-free-markets---the-hard-way.html">credit-crunch article in the Telegraph</a>. The key bit for me was:  </p>

<p>There is a pure free market position which holds that no financial institution should be bailed out – ever. If this approach was followed, people would factor much more risk into their behaviour …</p></blockquote>

            <p>After <a href="http://blog.tlocke.org.uk/2008/08/luminous.html">reading Luminous</a>, I was pleased when Janos plonked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_%28story_collection%29">Axiomatic</a> on my desk. I wasn't disappointed. Perhaps Axiomatic is the superior collection? Written in 1995, it's way ahead of its time.
