              <p>Some time ago I started reading a Wendy Perriam. 'The 50 minute hour ' I think it was called. I found I just couldn't get into it. Perriam was an author I remember my mum reading, so I thought I'd give her another go with Lying. I believe that Perriam has …</p>

              <p>Toby asked what I thought of a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/rogerbootle/3043978/Financial-Crisis-How-we-have-learned-the-limits-to-free-markets---the-hard-way.html">credit-crunch article in the Telegraph</a>. The key bit for me was:  </p>
