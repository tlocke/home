            <p>As well as Bill and Pascal, Jo and Phil went along to Monday's Science Cafe. Jo and Phil work for a pharmaceuticals company, so phrases like 'recombinant DNA' hold no fear for them!  </p>

            <p>Some time ago I started reading a Wendy Perriam. 'The 50 minute hour ' I think it was called. I found I just couldn't get into it. Perriam was an author I remember my mum reading, so I thought I'd give her another go with Lying. I believe that Perriam has …</p>

            <p>Toby asked what I thought of a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/rogerbootle/3043978/Financial-Crisis-How-we-have-learned-the-limits-to-free-markets---the-hard-way.html">credit-crunch article in the Telegraph</a>. The key bit for me was:  </p>

<p>There is a pure free market position which holds that no financial institution should be bailed out – ever. If this approach was followed, people would factor much more risk into their behaviour …</p></blockquote>

            <p>After <a href="http://blog.tlocke.org.uk/2008/08/luminous.html">reading Luminous</a>, I was pleased when Janos plonked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_%28story_collection%29">Axiomatic</a> on my desk. I wasn't disappointed. Perhaps Axiomatic is the superior collection? Written in 1995, it's way ahead of its time. The sort of things Egan writes about, free will, the neurological basis for decision making, parallel universes, brain and …</p>

<p>Katherine said, 'It's a divergent infinite series, so the question doesn't have an answer'. I was impressed!  </p>

            <p>I've just listened to David King saying that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7603257.stm">we should switch our research funding</a> away from fundamental research and direct it towards the practical problems we face, such as climate change, population growth and AIDS in poor countries.  </p>
