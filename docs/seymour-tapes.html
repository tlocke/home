    <p>I saw Tim Lott on tv once, he was taking part in a discussion on one of those arts review programmes. He dominated the argument, talking forcefully, almost agressively. Armando Iannucci was there (seemed a bit unsure of himself) and also Andrew Davies. Davies was Lott's main opponent, but no match for him.  </p>
<p>In The Seymour Tapes, Lott writes about a bloke who secretly films his family. At one point he had a dilemma in that he saw a misdemeanor by his child, but couldn't confront him with the evidence because that would reveal how he obtained it.  </p>
<p>This is similar to the government's problem with phone tap evidence. In the government's case they should either do nothing, or they should go ahead and present the evidence.</p>
