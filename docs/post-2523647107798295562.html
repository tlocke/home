    <p>New Scientist asked me to write a piece on the mathematical<br>
paradoxes associated with elections. I had 1500 words to<br>
play with. Many items were passing references<br>
to alert readers to interesting related topics. I wasn't<br>
writing a technical treatise.  </p>
<p>Any interested reader can<br>
get the full story from the Internet. Readers<br>
should also understand that the tone of the piece was not<br>
a scholarly critique of electoral systems, but a bit of fun<br>
with some maths in the context of a coming election.  </p>
<p>They will also understand, I would hope, that subeditors<br>
at magazines like to spice up the narrative a little, and<br>
that the extent to which the various systems are 'unfair'<br>
is often minor - as the examples show.</p>
