    <p>I find it difficult to throw things out. This first photo is of a wind-up radio that my parents gave me years ago. It's been broken for ages but I couldn't bring myself to throw it out because it's one of the few things that connects me with my mother. It's gone now, and she would probably have been pleased because she was all for throwing things out.  </p>

<p>This is a bag of material for curtains that my mother gave me a long time ago. I didn't like the material, so never used it, but it was a precious gift so I kept it. But you can't keep everything for ever, so hopefully this photo will preserve the memory for a bit longer.  </p>
