<p>Okay, this may get a bit tedious and involved, but I just need to get it off my chest. I all happened when I was travelling from Trowbridge to Swindon by train on Saturday, then coming back the next day.  </p>
<p>I travelled from Trowbridge to Bath Spa on my season ticket. At Bath there wasn't time to buy a ticket before the train departed for Swindon, so I hopped on, thinking I'd buy a ticket on the train or at Swindon.  </p>
<p>At Swindon I asked if I could buy a return from Bath to Swindon. The person said yes, and led me to the ticket office. The ticket office person refused, saying that I had illegally travelled without a ticked, and I'd have to pay for two singles rather than a return. I argued my case for about half an hour before capitulating. During this time all sorts of security people and supervisors were brought on the scene.  </p>
<p>I make a plea to the rail regulator, please can we change the rules so that as long as you buy a ticket at the first convenient opportunity, nobody gets penalised?</p>
