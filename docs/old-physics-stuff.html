    <p>This is the box with all my old physics stuff in. A lot of wonderful books that I never properly understood. I wish I could spend some more time understanding it. I wasn't very good at physics, but could understand enough to find it interesting.  </p>
<p>Looking back over the folder of work, I'm impressed that anyone (let alone me) could understand all the gobbledegook, and yet at one time I did understand things like solving Schroedinger's wave equation for a potential well.  </p>
<p>I could never understand anything through lectures, I always preferred reading books. The lectures told you what was on the syllabus though. In the second year my friend Chris was a year ahead of me, and he gave me his notes on the second year and I didn't go to any lectures. I did well that year, better than the final year when I had to go to lectures!  </p>
