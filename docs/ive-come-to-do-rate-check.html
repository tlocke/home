    <p>The doorbell sounded yesterday. My housemate answered and shouted up that it was for me. At the door was a man who stated, 'I'm from the local electricity company SSE, and I've come to do a rate check' (or words to that effect).</p>
<p>In the UK the electricity industry is divided into companies which own the wires (the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_network_operator">DNO</a>), and the retailers of electricity (the supplier). DNOs are a regulated monopoly, but each customer can choose their supplier.</p>
<p>The objection I have is that my caller was being a bit misleading to imply that it was a technical, statutory check that needed to be done, when really he was trying to get me switch supplier to SSE.</p>
