                  Improvements For Pedestrians Of Oldfield Park

            <p>Inspired by a recent <a href="https://beta.bathnes.gov.uk/liveable-neighbourhoods">BANES Liveable
Neighbourhoods</a> workshop, here are
my four suggestions for minor changes that could greatly improve things for the walkers
and wheelers of Oldfield Park. The map images below are clickable, taking you to the
actual map.</p>
<h3>Junction Of Oldfield Road And Wells Road</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">
  <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=51.37452&mlon=-2.36864#map=19/51.37452/-2.36864">
    <img alt="Junction Of Oldfiled Road And Wells Road"
      src="/images/2022/wells_road_map.png">
  </a>
</p>

<p>People walking to the centre of Bath from Oldfield Park often walk along Oldfield Road
and then cross Wells Road and then continue along the footpath opposite (the dashed red
line). At the point where pedestrians have to cross, Wells Road is wide, busy and at a
bend, which makes crossing difficult. I've put a blue blob on the map above to show the
position where a pedestrian island could be put, to make crossing easier.</p>
<h3>Junction Of Livingstone Road And Brougham Hayes</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">
  <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=51.37839&mlon=-2.37663#map=19/51.37839/-2.37663&layers=N">
    <img alt="Junction Of Livingstone Road And Brougham Hayes"
      src="/images/2022/livingstone_road_map.png">
  </a>
</p>

<p>Another walking route to the centre of Bath from Oldfield Park is along Livingstone Road
and then along Brougham Hayes. This often involves crossing Livingstone Road from the
south side to the north side, just before it joins Brougham Hayes. This crossing is
hazardous because it's busy with traffic, and cars often turn quickly into Livingstone
Road from Brougham Hayes. I've put a blue line on the map going down the middle of Livingstone Road from Brougham Hayes, to represent a possible elongated pedestrian island to
make the crossing easier.</p>
<h3>Narrowing Triangle North Where It Meets Moorland Road</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">
  <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=51.37881&mlon=-2.38076#map=19/51.37881/-2.38076&layers=N">
    <img alt="Narrowing Triangle North"
        src="/images/2022/triangle_north_map.png">
  </a>
</p>

<p>Pedestrians find it difficult to cross Triangle North where it meets Moorland Road
(marked in blue on the map), because cars dash down Moorland Road and turn left into
Triangle North. It could be made easier to cross by narrowing the entrance to Triangle
North, possibly by extending the pavement from the north side of the entrance.</p>
<h3>Widening The East Pavement On Moorland Road Between Triangle North And Triangle East</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">
  <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/51.37849/-2.38061&layers=N">
    <img alt="Widening Pavement Moorland Road"
      src="/images/2022/moorland_road_map.png">
  </a>
</p>

<p>The east pavement of Moorland Road is very narrow between Triangle North and Triangle
East, and so if there are two people walking in opposite directions, one of them has to
go onto the road. Things would be improved if the hedge were cut back to the fence, but
this wouldn't be enough and so perhaps the pavement could be widened over this section?</p>

            <p>I became concerned that despite their appalling and illegal rule, failing to recognise
the <em>de facto</em> Taliban government of Afghanistan was doing more harm than good,
so I wrote to my MP, Liberal Democrat Wera Hobhouse:</p>
