</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>I don't want my projects to track users, so I'm getting rid of
<a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a>. I've gone on to my
Google Analytics account and found 7 tracking codes that I've set up.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first one is the code for OwnId, which was a website that made it easy
  to use a custom host name as your OpenId. OpenId never really took off,
  email addresses are easier as an ID than host names. The code is in an
  <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/openid-delegator/">SVN repository on Google
  Code</a>, and I've removed
  the tracking id from Google Analytics.</li>
<li>I've got Google Analytics tracking ID set up for my old blog. In the blog
  settings it's not activated though. I've deleted the tracking id from
  Google Analytics now.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mtrhub.com/">MtrHub</a> is a website I made for keeping track of
  utility meter readings. Looking at the code and the website I don't think it
  currently uses Google Analytics. I've deleted teh tracking id form Google
  Analytics now.</li>
<li>There's also a tracking id for the http://www.own-id.com/. That's closed now
  so I've deleted the tracking id.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.polifesto.com/">Polifesto</a> is a website for anyone to write a
  political manifesto. It doesn't look like it uses Google Analytics at the
  moment. I've deleted its tracking id.</li>
<li>My old website which http://www.tlocke.org.uk used to point to, apparently
  had a tracking id. The site on Google Pages in GSUite. I've turned off
  Google Pages for <code>tlocke.org.uk</code>. I've deleted its tracking id.</li>
<li>Finally, my <a href="http://maths.tlocke.org.uk">maths website</a>, doesn't use
  Google Analytics any more, so I've deleted its tracking id.</li>
</ul>
<p>That was a lot easier than I thought it would be.</p>
<p>And now I've deleted my Google Analytics account!</p>            </article>
