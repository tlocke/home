            <p>I became concerned that failing to recognise the <em>de facto</em> Taliban government of
Afghanistan was doing more harm than good, so I wrote to my MP, Liberal Democrat Wera
Hobhouse:</p>
<blockquote>

Subject: Recognising the Afghan government<br></p>
<p>Hi Wera, I'm writing in support of international recognition of the
government in Afghanistan. I'm not sure what the official Lib Dem view is
on this issue, but I wanted to register my view that the people of
Afghanistan are suffering terribly at the moment, and the famine is set to
get worse, and their suffering would be alleviated by recognition of the
government.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tony Locke </p>
</blockquote>
<p>and I received the following reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From: Office Of Wera Hobhouse<br>
Date: Fri, 11 Feb 2022 at 14:11<br>
Subject: Re: Recognising the Afghan government<br>
To: Tony Locke<br></p>
<p>Dear Tony,</p>
<p>Thank you for your email.</p>
<p>Nobody will have followed the recent events in Afghanistan without feeling great
alarm, worry and shame about the failure of the West to stop the advance of the
Taliban and support the people in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>My Liberal Democrat colleagues and I do not believe in recognising the Taliban as the
official Government of Afghanistan. The withdrawal from Afghanistan has made the
British people less safe by shrinking our role on the world stage and failing to work
with other countries to combat the threat of terrorism. The Government has left it to
become a breeding ground for Al-Qaeda again, without a thought to the impact on our
national security.</p>
<p>The Taliban’s gaining of control over Afghanistan, including Panjshir, is devastating
for millions of innocent women and girls who are fearing for their lives. Their
liberties and rights are in the process of being extinguished once again.</p>
<p>The Liberal Democrats called for an immediate commitment to resettle 20,000 Afghan
refugees as a bare minimum. The priority should be to bring those most at risk to
safety through an emergency Women and Girls Resettlement Scheme. The Government’s
plans to resettle 5,000 refugees is not enough.</p>
<p>The Home Office’s statement in Parliament in early January 2022, formerly launching
the Afghan Citizen Resettlement Scheme, revealed that women, girls, and religious and
other minorities in Afghanistan have been put to the back of queue of the
Government's resettlement scheme.</p>
<p>Back in August 2021, this Government made a promise to women, girls, and religious
and other minorities in Afghanistan - that they would be a priority under the new
Afghan Citizen Resettlement Scheme. That was a promise of hope to these people, at a
time when they are living in fear from the Taliban because of their identity.</p>
<p>Now, the Conservative Government has not only broken that promise, they have
effectively told these Afghans that they are at the back of the queue. The Ministers
responsible for this callous decision – which will cost lives – should hang their
heads in shame. The UK has a proud history of providing sanctuary to those in need.
The Liberal Democrats believe that the Government needs to show that same leadership
and compassion now.</p>
<p>The Government must also ensure it is doing all it can to provide a safe exit for
those in third countries who risk dangerous deportation to Afghanistan. The Liberal
Democrats are calling on the government to work with international allies to
establish a safe passage corridor for all those in Afghanistan who need to flee the
Taliban and to provide aid to those remaining in Afghanistan, a call echoed by NGO,
Refugees International.</p>
<p>Thank you again for writing to me, and please do not hesitate to get in touch if I
can be of any further assistance.</p>
<p>With best wishes,</p>
<p>Wera Hobhouse
Liberal Democrat MP for Bath</p>
