            <p>It's good when people recommend books, because you get to read something that you wouldn't otherwise have read. So it was with Girl With A Pearl Earring. This is a historical coming-of-age story, that carefully describes a young woman's thoughts and emotions as she is employed in the Vermeer household …</p>

            <p>Some time ago, while visiting Matt in Oxford, we came back from his PhD celebrations and sat in his kitchen for a bit. One of his housemates was there and talked about Charles Dickens. I opined that Dickens was sentimental, melodramatic and at times lurid. She recommended Anthony Trollope. I …</p>

            <p>I'm reading Alastair Reynolds Revelation Space series in a bit of a random order. I've just finished <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chasm_City">Chasm City</a>. As I read, I find myself thinking that the characters are humans in an unusual setting. Whereas I think that our future is that we'll become less human. Our brains haven't …</p>

            <p>Like <a href="/charles-stross.html">Wireless</a>, Toast is another collection of Charles Stross short stories lent to me by Janos. For me, Toast maintains a higher average standard than Wireless, although Wireless does have some cracking stories.  </p>
<p>I hugely enjoyed Toast, and of all the sci-fi I read, these stories come the closest to …</p>

            <p>Whenever I read John Wyndham, I'm struck by how prescient his thoughts are. Here he is talking about what we'd now call <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_technology">disruptive technologies</a>:  </p>

            <p>Palimpsest is the last story of Wireless, a collection of short stories by Charles Stross. Janos recommended Stross. In fact he did more than that, he presented me with a plastic bag filled with sci-fi books, one of which was Wireless!  </p>

Finished reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herland_%28novel%29">Herland</a>, by Charlotte Perkins Gilman. Herland is a feminist utopia, an undiscovered realm populated entirely by women. It's easy to mock utopias, but they're much harder to write about than dystopias, so I admire anyone who has …</p>

            <p>Alastair Reynolds is a consistently fine writer. I've recently finished Zima Blue, a book of Reynolds' short stories, and every one has been superb. Reynolds is becoming one of my most highly rated sci-fi authors. I've lent the book to Bob at work, who's a sci-fi fan, he's sure to …</p>
