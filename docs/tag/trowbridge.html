            <p>I live in Trowbridge Central, and tomorrow there's a by-election for the Town Council and the District Council. Maybe I've not looked hard enough, but I couldn't find any info about the election on the <a href="http://www.trowbridge.gov.uk/viewcontent.asp?id=137">Town Council website</a>. I'd have expected to see a list of the candidates at the very least.  </p>
<p>The parties themselves are very varied in the information they provide. The Conservatives had <a href="http://www.westwiltsconservatives.com/">quite a long piece</a> on their candidate, and a <a href="http://www.westwiltsconservatives.com/page.php?pid=37">useful list of by-elections</a>. The <a href="http://www.wiltshirelibdems.org.uk/pages/wwdc.html">Liberal Democrats</a> had nothing, and neither did <a href="http://southwest.greenparty.org.uk/elections">the greens</a>.  </p>
<p>Please correct me if you know different.  </p>
<p>Who am I going to vote for? I'd like to reward the Conservatives for actually communicating with the electorate, but I'll probably vote Liberal Democrat.</p>

            <p>I've just got my polling card for the <a href="http://www.westwiltshire.gov.uk/index/council/democratic_processes_and_events/elections-voting/elections-forthcoming/trowbridge-central-100708.htm">Trowbridge Central Elections 10th July 2008</a> but I can't find a list of who's standing, so I don't know how to vote. Can anyone help?</p>

            <p>On Thursday there's a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiltshire#Politics_and_administration">Wiltshire County Council</a> by-election for my ward, Trowbridge East. I've done a little table to help me decide who to vote for. Don't rely on this table for your own information, look at the primary sources.</p>
