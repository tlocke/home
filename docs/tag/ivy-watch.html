            <p>As you know, I'm <a href="/ivy-league.html">growing ivy on the walls of my house</a> to keep it cool in summer and warm in winter. Last year I posted a <a href="/ivy-watch.html">series of photos</a> of the ivy I'm growing. Here's how the ivy looks like now:  </p>
<p><em>Pamela Flitton</em> is doing the best. The only problem is that I have to keep cutting it back to prevent her from encroaching on my neighbour's part of the wall. The other only problem is that she's started to grow onto the patio door, so I've had to cut her back.  </p>
<p><img alt="Ivy 1" src="/images/2010/2010-08-08_14_34_50.jpg">  </p>
<p><em>Lord Widmerpool</em> is also doing really well. He's starting to grow on the door. Should I continue to allow that?  </p>
<p><img alt="Ivy 2" src="/images/2010/2010-08-08_14_35_12.jpg">  </p>
<p><em>Ted Jeavons</em> grows against the back of the garage wall. Getting along nicely, but won't really help in insulating the house.  </p>
<p><img alt="Ivy 3" src="/images/2010/2010-08-08_14_35_29.jpg">  </p>
<p>I haven't shown you <em>Jessica Biel</em> before, but she's the most important ivy. Unfortunately she's not doing well. Why? What nutrients does ivy need to thrive? Btw, after months of sunshine my lawn is looking like it's in a very sorry state :-(  </p>
<p><img alt="Ivy 4" src="/images/2010/2010-08-08_14_33_52.jpg"></p>
<p><em>Jane Eyre</em> is the second most important ivy plant, and so I'm pleased that she's steadily covering the wall.  </p>

              <p>Many complain that this blog is boring. The words, 'leaden', 'turgid' and 'moribund' crop up an awful lot in criticisms. Well, I plan to confound my critics with a special series called <strong>Ivy Watch</strong>!  </p>
<p>Yes, each week you can check on the progress of my ivy plants! Let me introduce â€¦</p>
