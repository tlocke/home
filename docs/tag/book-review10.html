            <p>My friend Zoe moved house recently, and was offering people books that otherwise would be thrown out. One of the books I took was 'The Watcher' by Jane Palmer. I think I'm probably missing the point somewhat, but it read like a children's book. Not that that's a bad thing …</p>

            <p>Blimp was surprised that I hadn't read 'A Dance to the Music of Time' so I thought I'd give it a go. The language is sophisticated, and I think I missed a lot of cultural references. Powell sometimes constructs sentences in an odd, contracted manner. The collection I read was …</p>

            <p>I've always instinctively loved the idea of markets, and in The Wisdom of Crowds, James Surowiecki gives a very readable exposition of the idea of groups making decisions. It could do with a bit of proof reading though. To remain true to the ideas he champions, Surowiecki should really have …</p>

            <p>This is supposed to be a note on some of the other books that I've been reading, but I can't get my mind off 'A Man in Full' (see my last post). The problem with philosophies is that they never seem to be able to encompass everything. It's the equivalent …</p>

            <p>A Man in Full is the first Tom Wolfe I've read. I've always intended to read The Electric Kool Aid Acid Test but never got round to it. Part of what happens in AMIF is that characters get into desparate situations and are then helped by the philosophy of the …</p>
