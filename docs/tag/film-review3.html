            <p>Moving, emotional, satisfying. I particularly like taking ideas seriously, and this film does that with the protagonist's outwardly odd behaviour. I know I always refer back to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:The_Fabric_of_Reality">The Fabric of Reality</a>, but Lars acts as if he's applying the approach of David Deutsch. I'll explain. Lars' mind has come up …</p>

            <p>2001: A Space Odyssey is one of those films you know a lot about before seeing it. Some would say, 'it carries a weight of expectation'. Well, one thing I can certainly say is that afterwards you really feel you've seen a *proper* film. I expect that Lawrence of Arabia …</p>

            <p>An excellent film that brought up all sorts of moral questions. Boringly, the solution to the problem of conflict diamonds is good regulation. Since the diamond trade is international, it covers many jurisdictions and this makes regulation more difficult. So the meta solution is supra-national political entities such as the …</p>

            <p>'The Opposite of Sex' would bear a second viewing. I think there's something wrong with my brain because I find it hard to follow sentences like, "she's my ex-boyfriend's cousin's sister". There seems to be more than average of that sort of thing going on in the film. It's enjoyable …</p>

            <p>When we watch a DVD at my house, it's not unusual for someone to walk out. This time it was Sarita that left. To be fair, she had seen it before and didn't like it the first time.  </p>

            <p>It was uncanny the way that every scene was exactly as I had imagined it when reading the book. Very moving, I was embarassed to be tearful several times during the film. The theme of typing, cleverly hinted at the fact that this was Briony's narrative. This device ran the …</p>
