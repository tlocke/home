            <p>Sitting alone in the Rondo theatre on a cold and misty Monday evening in November, a few weeks before my 39th birthday, preparing to watch a documentary on <a href="http://www.intoeternitythemovie.com/">nuclear waste disposal in Finland</a>, I wondered what my life had come to.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.intoeternitythemovie.com/"><img alt="Into Eternity" src="http://www.intoeternitythemovie.com/themes/intoeternity/images/logo.jpg"></a>  </p>
<p>The waste in the film has to be stored for 100,000 years before it decays to a non-radioactive substance. The experts say it can stay for around 100 years on the surface, but beyond that it becomes impossible to predict what might happen. The solution is to bury it deep in the rock so that it could only be exposed by people with the technology to understand the dangers of radiation.</p>
<p>My prediction is that we'll be able to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_transmutation">transmute</a> radioactive waste into harmless elements in a few decades. That shouldn't be relied upon though, and any company wanting to build a nuclear power station should be required to build a long term storage facility beforehand.</p>

            <p>Shantini suggested that we see Inception, and I agreed enthusiastically.  </p>

<p>Early on in the film, a character asked, 'why do you need an architect?', I laughed when they replied, 'they're the closest thing to creators of worlds in people's minds'. So not computer game designers then? Of course, an architect …</p>

            <p>I feel physically weighed down by a sense of nostalgia after watching Breakfast Club. It's the first time I've seen it, but the clothes, the music and the atmosphere brought back my memories of the eighties. I was 10 in 1981.  </p>

            <p>Yesterday was devoted to roast chestnuts, fondue and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogville">Dogville</a>. A film I'd happily watch again. I always ask what the message or subtext of a film is. I've come to the conclusion that Dogville could only be made about a time and place where the police are corrupt, rather than …</p>

            <p>I saw Avatar in glorious 3D on Sunday. Thank you to Sarita and Bill. It was a fantastic film. Everyone had a view beforehand on whether the 3D was a good idea. Kazim had seen it in 2D and said 3D was a gimmick. Jamie had seen it in 3 …</p>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_Souls">Cold Souls</a> did indeed remind me of Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind. Paul Giamatti makes anything watchable. He reminds me of Woody Allen. Brainy, introverted and whiny. Cold Souls is a gentle, enjoyable comedy.  </p>

We went to see this at the Little Theatre yesterday. It was a good film for a number of reasons:  </p>
<ul>
<li>It had the tension and excitement of a thriller.</li>
<li>The aesthetic of grubby hi-tech was well done.</li>
<li>The technology was believable.</li>

<li>The dialogue was well written …</li></ul>
