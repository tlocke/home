<p>I dreamt I drove a car out of a driveway, but I was driving it while leaning over from the back seat. I could really only steer, although I attempted to operate the pedals with my hands. On the way out I hit two cars. The person whose cars I'd hit saw me and retaliated by ramming my car.  </p>
<p>Afterwards I felt guilt and self-reproach for having done such a stupid thing, although I kept telling myself that nobody had been hurt.  </p>
<p>Btw, I don't own a BMW, I don't even own a car!</p>

            <p>I dreamt that I saw a very ill child, a toddler, lying in bed with a lurid green face. I said that he had to be taken to hospital. His mother said they were going to take him, as soon as the father came back. I said NO, the child …</p>

<p>I dreamt I started a new job writing software. They didn't have a computer for me, but eventually they found a really old 286 and an old-fashioned printer. I was worried that I wouldn't be able to do the job working on such hardware. Nobody was very nice to me …</p>
