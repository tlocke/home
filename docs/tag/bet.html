            <p>Like <a href="/charles-stross.html">Wireless</a>, Toast is another collection of Charles Stross short stories lent to me by Janos. For me, Toast maintains a higher average standard than Wireless, although Wireless does have some cracking stories.  </p>
<p>I hugely enjoyed Toast, and of all the sci-fi I read, these stories come the closest to my own notions about our future. Stross has been influenced by the sort of things Ray Kurzweil talks about; the singularity, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computronium">computronium</a>, uploading living things neuron by neuron.  </p>
<p>Btw, I asked Janos the
<a href="/driverless-cars-in-nevada.html">robot cars question</a>, and he gave a considered 'no'.</p>

            <p>In August 2008, I wrote in <a href="/home-james-and-dont-spare-cpus.html">Home James, and don't spare the CPUs</a> that by the time my eldest nephew is of driving age (2023), most cars will be driven by robots. I'm still sticking to my assertion! Ben at work agrees, but Laura doesn't. My friend Andy disagrees, but …</p>

            <p>One of my <a href="http://www.tlocke.org.uk/9">bets</a> is that the heading of the ball will be banned in football. I sent some new evidence to Toby:  </p>

            <p>On Monday I went to the excellent <a href="http://www.cafescientifique.org/bath.htm">Bath Science Cafe</a>, where the talk was on the science of replacing oil with biofuels in transport. The greater part of the evening is a discussion with everyone in the pub and people are encouraged to put questions to speaker. I asked, 'What's …</p>

            <p>I hate it when people with opinions don't put their money where their mouth is. I've put up a <a href="http://www.tlocke.org.uk/page/9">page of bets</a> to record my wagers. Actually they don't specify what the loser has to pay out, really it's just reputations that are on the line!  </p>
