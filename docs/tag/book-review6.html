I <a href="/star-fraction.html">read MacLeod's The Star Fraction</a> over a year ago now. I enjoyed it, and Newton's Wake is even better.

            <p>We were discussing racism, and my dad recommended <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chamber">The Chamber</a>. I'd heard people talk about John Grisham, and I must admit I'd avoided him. However, the Chamber was very well written. Good plot, and Grisham really does capture the mood of the prison in the American south (I say that …</p>

Ian McEwan's writing. He's reflective and introspective through his characters, without indulging in navel gazing. You get the feeling that a huge amount of effort goes into his books.  </p>

<p>It's so sad that Michael Crichton has died. It's selfish, but I'd have loved to have heard his thoughts on global warming as time went on, and I've always enjoyed his books. State Of Fear seems to challenge the idea of global warming, and attacks the atmosphere in which it's …</p>

<p>It has a 50s feel to it. I like the descriptions of the protagonist's inner life. It seems incredible to us that such early machines could become conscious. However, he was on the right track...</p>

            <p>From the writing style I could have sworn that C. S. Friedman was male. It's possibly a tribute to a writer to be unable to discern their gender.  </p>

            <p>I'd approached <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Chaitin">Gregory Chaitin</a> before, but it was one of his technical books, too difficult for me. I did learn a bit about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_%28programming_language%29">LISP</a> from it though. I ordered <em>Meta Math!: The Quest for Omega</em> from the library, and it was much more readable, although still difficult.  </p>
