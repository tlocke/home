<p>This film is prescient about so much:  </p>

<p>The poster says, 'Everybody's talking about it!' and people do still talk of it, so I thought I should see what it was all about. So Kazim and Liz came over and we watched Citizen Kane.  </p>
<p>For me, the film is a morality tale. Its essence is revealed when Kane's …</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_%28novel%29">Saturday</a> lived up to my high expectations. I don't know for sure, but I'd guess that in these two books the world that is described is very different from McEwan's background. I supposed all books …</p>

            <p>On the Sunday after Christmas, we went for a walk along the Canal to the Mad Hatter for high tea. The plan was to then go back to my house to see a film. It was between Persepolis, Eyes Wide Shut and the English patient. I cut the Gordian Knot …</p>

            <p>I've never seen a Stanley Kubrick film I didn't like, so when Matt suggested <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Lyndon">Barry Lyndon</a> (which I'd never heard of) I tucked it away in my memory.  </p>

            <p>I visited Matt in Oxford last weekend. The day before he said, 'Tony, some friends are going to the cinema in the afternoon, are you up for that?'. It turned out to be his 5 year old god son's birthday party! <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madagascar_2">Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa</a> was actually very good. It's …</p>

            <p>I've read several books and things since we last spoke. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distress_%28novel%29">Distress</a> is impressive. The author's voice comes through with a clear view of the world, and one that is similar to my own. Often I snort derisively at the TV, films and sometimes books. Egan's work has the opposite effect …</p>

            <p>Some time ago I started reading a Wendy Perriam. 'The 50 minute hour ' I think it was called. I found I just couldn't get into it. Perriam was an author I remember my mum reading, so I thought I'd give her another go with Lying. I believe that Perriam has …</p>

            <p>I don't really know about acting, and I don't know the names of actors, but Heath Ledger as The Joker was brilliant.  </p>

            <p>These are two separate things, the film 'Akira', and 'The Beach' by Alex Garland. It's not like Jonah and the Whale.  </p>
