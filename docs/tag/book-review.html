</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>The Hydrogen Sonata was one of the books I picked up from the library to read on holiday. I read bits now and again, but didn't find myself engaged with it for some reason. Then, in the last quarter of the book I began to feel excited about it. It stayed that way to the end.  </p>
<p>Is it inevitable that as life becomes more technically advanced, society becomes more morally advanced? Even though humans have been unchanged in their abilities for about 10,000 years, our society has steadily improved morally as well as technically. Is this inevitable? Will this continue as AIs take over from humans?  </p>
<p>My answer is yes. Democracy and the rule of law has improved things for people because it's a solution to the prisoners' dilemma. More advanced AIs will recognise this more clearly and so I hope the rule of law and democracy will continue.</p>            </article>
