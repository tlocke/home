            <p>I fancied reading one of Malcolm Bradbury's campus novels, but what caught my eye in Bath Central Library was Ray Bradbury's A Graveyard For Lunatics.  </p>
<p>Ages ago in the summer, probably 1992, Steve from Uni invited me out to his parents' house in France. There were two books there that …</p>

            <p>I intended to write how corporations are amoral and only concerned with profit, and this isn't a bad thing. Corporations are best seen as a force of nature like the sea. We rightly compel corporations to follow laws, and it's the laws that convey our morality, and the laws that …</p>

            <p>I've long been annoyed at how bad public transport is, and I've long been mulling over an idea to make it actually work. I've put up an <strong><a href="http://www.tlocke.org.uk/page/6">article called Public Transport 2.0</a></strong> explaining the idea. Let me know what you think.</p>

            <p>Andy left a comment on <a href="/eu-holocaust-denial-ban.html">EU holocaust denial ban</a>, that really posed the question: what, if any, are the limits of free speech? I remembered an <a href="">interview with Noam Chomsky</a> where he said:  </p>

            <p>The short answer to your first question is yes. However, since cars wear out, the increased CO2 emissions are only temporary. My giving up driving is the green bit, and selling the car gives me a financial reward at the cost of some CO2 emissions. So it's mixed but the …</p>
