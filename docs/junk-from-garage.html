    <p>Regarding the title, that's not junk in the Ke\$ha sense. I think it was on Tuesday 23rd April that the contents of my garage in Trowbridge was moved to Bath by Me &amp; My Van. The tenants had moved in the previous day, and so the removal of the contents of the garage was somewhat overdue. This is the stack of stuff that I have to deal with. It's completely blocking access to the downstairs loo. It's right against a radiator, so I can't have the heating on.  </p>
<p><img alt="Junk 1" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120427_222612.jpg"></p>
<p>I seem to remember that it was in the 4th year at Dauntsey's that I made this contraption. The design brief was to make a self powered vehicle that would drive to the edge of a table top, and then stop before it went over the edge. This was my effort; the wheeled probe dropped off the edge of the table and blocked the driving wheels. I remember that I put rubber bands around the driving wheels to get more traction for starting and mainly for stopping.  </p>
<p><img alt="Junk 2" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120427_223126.jpg"></p>
<p>A better view of the stopping mechanism. At school we were in an old building while a brand new CDT facility was being built.  </p>
<p><img alt="Vehicle" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120427_223150.jpg"></p>
<p>I think this was made in the 3rd year, at St. Laurence School. It was designed for a competition between schools. The crocodile / dragon monster was propelled by rubber bands, and the jaws went up and down in a chomping motion as it went along. There were smoke bombs in the nostrils. Unfortunately the teacher messed up the times and when we arrived my category of the competition was over!  </p>

<p>Fast forward to my job at Open World. I think this was drawn by Miranda, I put it up by my desk.  </p>

<p>As a child / teenager I used to be really into typography. I didn't know it was called that though :-)  </p>

<p>Called 'List Of Possible Albums'. From time at Dauntsey's. Perhaps a list of albums to buy? I think more likely a choice of album to do an alternative cover for.  </p>

<p>Sketching out the sheets for the CDT project to design and make a device to help people pick things up.  </p>

<p><img alt="House" src="/images/2012/IMG_20120428_150109.jpg"></p>
<p>Drawing of a plant. I'd read that Charles Rennie Mackintosh did a lot of drawings of plants and that fed through into his work, so I copied that idea.  </p>

<p>The lamp was part of my CDT GCSE exam. It used a halogen bulb, which had a temporary plastic cover. Unfortunately I left the temporary cover on, and the teacher didn't notice to take it off when the examiner came to look at it, so the examiner didn't get to see the lamp working properly.  </p>
