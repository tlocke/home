            <p>It seems a good idea to store your bookmarks on the web, then you always have them with you, whatever computer you're on. I had a look at bookmarking websites some time ago, and for some reason decided they weren't that good. Sarah at work got me thinking about them …</p>

            <p>One of the tiresome things about the web is remembering so many different usernames and passwords, and having to enter them all the time. Today I just signed up for an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID">OpenId</a> with <a href="https://www.myopenid.com/">MyOpenId.com</a>. It'll mean that for participating web sites I'll only have to sign in once. Great …</p>

            <p>My car sits in the garage unused. It's in good working order and I've got a licence to drive it, it's MOTed and insured and everything. I've got two reasons for selling:  </p>

            <p>A wiki, by definition is collaborative. a non-collaborative wiki is a paradox surely?  </p>
<p>I understand where you coming from, but perhaps there should be another term for what you are doing, which essentially is generating web content using wiki tools?  </p>

            <p>Thanks to Emily and Bob for pointing out an
<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/lifestyle/article2579329.ece">article</a>
in the Independent about green electricity that's relevant to my
<a href="/was-i-right-to-change-to-good-energy.html">post about Good Energy</a>.
The article seems to support the view that the extra greenness that Good Energy gives is the retired ROCs.</p>
