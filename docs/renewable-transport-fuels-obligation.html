    <p>According to Greenpeace:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] the Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation (RTFO) will force fuel companies to include biofuels as part of their fuel mix. [...] 2.5 per cent of all petrol and diesel sold in the UK will come from crops such as palm oil and maize.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's why RTFO is a bad idea:  </p>
<p>Say I take a (diesel) train to work, but I've adapted my house so that it is zero carbon. My neighbour cycles to work but lives in a draughty house. Even if our carbon emissions are the same, our penalties aren't the same. There's a higher price for emitting carbon by burning diesel than for the same emissions from burning gas to heat a house.  </p>
<p>Okay, you may concede that the penalties for CO2 emissions aren't the same, but why is that so bad?  </p>
<p>In the above example, you could say that I should live like my neighbour (I shouldn't have insulated my house and I should cycle to work) and then I wouldn't be paying a higher CO2 penalty. This would have a detrimental effect on my finances because a local job would be less well paid, and so would be detrimental effect to the economy.  </p>
<p>In summary, having unequal penalties for different ways of emitting CO2 is worse for the economy than having single penalty rate for all types of CO2 emissions. Such a single rate system is <a href="http://sites.google.com/a/tlocke.org.uk/tlocke/1">CO2 TaxBack</a>.</p>
