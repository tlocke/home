    <p>Living to over 145 years, flying carpets, a year of continuous rain followed by 10 years of drought. These preposterous things occur in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Hundred_Years_of_Solitude">One hundred years of solitude</a> by Gabriel Garcia Marquez. I'm literal minded, and so I also found difficult all the premonitions and apparitions and such.  </p>
<p>Generation after generation is dysfunctional. The characters are weird and unhappy. It left me feeling hopeless. Readers have described the book's atmosphere as dreamlike. To me it was nightmarish.  </p>
<p>Perhaps this book presents a mature view of the world that I'm just not ready for. Maybe the devices that I find anoying are in fact clever ways of conveying life's truths.  </p>
<p>As an aside, when Ursula was confined to her room in her later years, she could tell what was going on in the house from the various sounds. In fact this gave her a unique insight into the other occupants. My housemate is like that. From her room she knows everthing that's going on.  </p>
<p>The ending was brilliant. A knockout blow delivered to free will!</p>
