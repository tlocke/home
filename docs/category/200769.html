            <p>I've switched <a href="http://sites.google.com/a/tlocke.org.uk/tlocke/Home">my site</a> over to Google Sites. I made the switch because I was fed up with the adverts for other wikis on Wetpaint. Here are my likes and dislikes about Google sites (or 'cheers and jeers' as they said on Family Guy). First the cheers:  </p>

            <p>I've just heard about the absurd idea to abolish parking charges at NHS hospitals. If this were to be done, it would (if I remember correctly) remove £78m from NHS treatment, surely a bad thing.  </p>

            <p>I'd heard lots of talk about Ayn Rand, and I'd already read Anthem online, so I ordered Fountainhead from Bath Central Library using their online reservation system. The system worked really well. Ultimately of course, books will be like music, where you just download it. Hopefully books will be licensed …</p>

I've done a little table to help me decide who to vote for. Don't rely on this table for your own information, look at the primary sources.</p>
