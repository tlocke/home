            <p>I loved <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freakonomics">this book</a>, although of course I didn't agree with all of it. Take the swimming pools versus guns thing. Levitt says that swimming pools are statistically more dangerous to kids to have at a house, than guns. That may be, but swimming pools are fun and so shouldn't …</p>

<p>I think of digital as being where a range of values correspond to another discrete value. In his book, The Digital River, Richard Dawkins says that …</p>

            <p>I think my boiler's getting furred up because I can hear fragments of limescale move around when I turn the central heating on. Also, I live in a hard water area and everything gets covered in limescale.  </p>

            <p>Limescale is starting to fur up the boiler in my house. The cheapest solution is one of those magnetic water conditioner things, but I'm doubtful that they work. There's an interesting <a href="http://www.cranfield.ac.uk/sas/water/magnets/">article from Cranfield University</a> that suggests that that anti-scale magnetic water treatment can work. I think I'll give the …</p>
