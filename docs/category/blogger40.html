            <p>I bought Silent Running off of Ebay a few days ago, and watched it on Sunday. The protagonist wasn't a laid-back hippy, he was a militant environmentalist. Of course he was wrong to murder those people. We don't know the political system he was living under, but if it was …</p>

            <p>I was listening to Marcus Brigstocke on the Now Show and he mentioned the <a href="http://libelreform.org/">Libel Reform</a> campaign. I'd like to see the <a href="http://www.polifesto.com/policies/22/">libel laws abolished</a>, never mind reformed. As far as I can see they're a way for rich people to prevent freedom of speech.

            <p>I bought some Speedo Essentials goggles and went swimming. They let in water, they were uncomfortable, they were wack. I took them back to the shop and exchanged them for <a href="http://store.speedo.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Product6_10151_10202_80300_-1_45352_33314_Y_80301">Speedo Futura Ice PLUS goggles</a>, which are the same as I used to have.<br>
