I always ask what the message or subtext of a film is. I've come to the conclusion that Dogville could only be made about a time and place where the police are corrupt, rather than …</p>

            <p>I agree with your stance on insurance. A lot of it is a straight-up unneccessary con and most of the rest can be dealt with in the way you describe. I think I'd always maintain some sort of house insurance, however, as it's just too big an item to ever …</p>
