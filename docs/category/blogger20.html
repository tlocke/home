            <p>In Macleod's book, the Execution Channel is a TV channel that shows judicial executions in real time. The idea is that the Chinese write most of the software in the world, including surveillance cameras for prisons. They include code that sends a copy of what's recorded back to a TV …</p>

            <p>I've noticed the phrase 'fuel poverty' being used. I find this phrase infuriating because it implies that someone could be wealthy in every way apart from fuel, which is absurd (assuming we're talking about the UK in the present day). It also implies that someone could be in poverty in …</p>
