            <p>Willem Buiter <a href="http://blogs.ft.com/maverecon/2007/12/---page-margin.html">writes that per capita CO2 emissions aren't important</a>. He's right that what we need is a global tax on every tonne of CO2Eq (carbon dioxide equivalent) emitted. But the revenue from that tax should be re-distributed among countries according to population size, according to the <a href="http://www.tlocke.org.uk/page/1">TaxBack</a> idea.</p>

            <p>'The Opposite of Sex' would bear a second viewing. I think there's something wrong with my brain because I find it hard to follow sentences like, "she's my ex-boyfriend's cousin's sister". There seems to be more than average of that sort of thing going on in the film. It's enjoyable …</p>

            <p>After reading a <a href="http://www.bluej.org/mrt/?p=34">post on the increasing complexity of Java</a>, I wonder if it may be time to have a Java equivalent of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)#Python_3000">Python 3000 project</a>.
