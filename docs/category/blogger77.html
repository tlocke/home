            <p>There's no current selection pressure to become 'grey goo'; a virus has no method of replicating itself other than hijacking other cells functions, and then having a mechanism to pass to another host. Viruses are also quite fragile in the environment, most need some sort of fluid transfer between hosts …</p>

            <p>Long answer: When people write Sci-fi they tend to write about what ifs, often reflecting hopes or more commonly fears in their current society. Would you have 1985 without the fear of communism, the I robot series with out fear of automation removing jobs. The genre has now become more …</p>

<p>In this and many other sci-fi books, democracy is ignored. Why is that?</p>

            <p>It says on the news that little information is coming out of Burma. Mobile phones cut off, internet cafes shut down etc. Regimes shut off the flow of information so that they can commit attrocities without anyone knowing. To get the information flowing again, why doesn't the UN fly over …</p>

            <p>The bailing out of Northern Rock was a misuse of taxpayer's money. The FSA aleady guarantees the first £2,000 and then 90% up to £33,000 of any deposits. The further guarantees that the bank was making just makes it more likely that banks will be even more reckless …</p>

            <p>Well, UK trains are among the cheapest in Europe if you include subsidies.  </p>
<p>But the main thing is that privatization only works if it's done well. I think UK rail was botched, so we're not really seeing all the benefit we could.  </p>

            <p>"drives standards up and prices down"! That hasn't worked very well, has it?  </p>
<p>I like your idea about government leaving private enterprise to it, but what happens when it's just not up to the job? Do you bail it out with public money - like with Railtrack and Northern Rock?</p>
