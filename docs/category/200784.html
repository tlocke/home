<li>My car runs on a fossil fuel and so contributes to global warming.  </li>

            <p>A wiki, by definition is collaborative. a non-collaborative wiki is a paradox surely?  </p>
<p>I understand where you coming from, but perhaps there should be another term for what you are doing, which essentially is generating web content using wiki tools?  </p>
<p>I suggest "WIKI Without Any Wiki Alterability" which nicely forms …</p>

in the Independent about green electricity that's relevant to my

            <p>Blimp was surprised that I hadn't read 'A Dance to the Music of Time' so I thought I'd give it a go. The language is sophisticated, and I think I missed a lot of cultural references. Powell sometimes constructs sentences in an odd, contracted manner. The collection I read was …</p>
