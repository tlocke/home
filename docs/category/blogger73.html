<p>Why do you make people redirect to your domain? isn't it easier to add the meta<br>

<p>I think the easiest method of delegating your OpenId depends on several factors:  </p>

<li>Do you have an editable web page under your own domain name?  </li>
<li>Are you comfortable with …</li></ol>

            <p>'The Opposite of Sex' would bear a second viewing. I think there's something wrong with my brain because I find it hard to follow sentences like, "she's my ex-boyfriend's cousin's sister". There seems to be more than average of that sort of thing going on in the film. It's enjoyable …</p>

            <p>After reading a <a href="http://www.bluej.org/mrt/?p=34">post on the increasing complexity of Java</a>, I wonder if it may be time to have a Java equivalent of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)#Python_3000">Python 3000 project</a>. I'd start off by getting rid of primitives.</p>

            <p>I had the idea for The-Elected.com in 1999, it would be a directory of the world's democratically elected politicians. I worked on it, and it came to fruition, but never really became popular. Then along came Wikipedia, and even though the information in The-Elected was marked up in XML …</p>
