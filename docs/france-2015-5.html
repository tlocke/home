    <p>Dave and Andy have asked me to take some photos of trains for their website. I protested that my camera's not very good and that I'm a rubbish photographer. Anyway, against my will here are some tram-related photos. There seems to be just one long track, stretching as far as the eye can see in either direction:  </p>
<p><img alt="Tram Tracks" src="/images/2015/IMG_20150714_115703.jpg"></p>
<p>It says 15mins until the next tram. Not very frequent.  </p>
<p><img alt="Next Tram" src="/images/2015/IMG_20150714_115830.jpg"></p>
<p>While walking over the bridge by the tram track, this graffito caught my eye:  </p>

<p>A tram approaches a stop:  </p>

<p>The eagle-eyed tram spotter will have spotted that while there are overhead wires on most bits, there aren't any on the bridge. It must have batteries or something.  </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.aulapinquifume.fr/">Au Lapin qui Fume</a> restaurant is excellent. Here's their signature entree, lapin terrine:  </p>

<p>I know that this says: No Swimming, but what does the bit underneath say?  </p>

<p>Il fait pleut. It's just a light rain, not cold, but it caught me unawares and I ducked into l'Indian Bar Cafe. Did I tell you that I like rain? Setting the scene, the usually bustling Rue Blanqui is all but deserted. I'm the only one sitting outside under the awning. A rubbish lorry came by and one of the guys waved a hearty bonjour, to which I replied enthusiastically. Of course, they had been waving at the cafe proprietor behind me. Awkward.  </p>
<p>A man in his sixties comes out to smoke. He has a phlegmatic mien. I remark, man to man, that it is raining. He doesn't understand. I try again and this time he understands what I've said, but not why I've said it. He goes back to his rollup, his weary view of humanity undisturbed.  </p>
<p>Oh God, Blue Shirt has arrived. Before I know it I've welcomed him to my table and bought him a coffee. Why, why, why??  </p>
<p>He's not a popular man. If I carry on encouraging him I'll become unpopular too.</p>
