Watch this video:<br>
<a href="http://hiddensecretsofmoney.com/videos/episode-4">http://hiddensecretsofmoney.com/videos/episode-4</a><br>
It explains what I was talking about with banks creating most of the money supply.<br>
Cheers<br>

I got to 9:41 into the video and found the bit that I disagreed with.<br>
So I agree with the first bit where the central bank (in this case the<br>
federal reserve) creates money by giving the bank a cheque. Then the<br>
video goes on to say that when a deposit is made, 90% is invested and<br>
10% is kept. This is correct, but it is <em>not</em> money creation. Putting<br>
money into a bank account that pays interest is an <em>investment</em>. If<br>
you want to avoid investing, then put the money in a safe deposit box.<br>
<br>

You are missing the point - with fractional reserve banking you end up with 10 times as much cash in circulation as the original deposit. It is money creation. It is loaned into existance.<br>
<br>

If you have £100 and deposit it in a bank, they'll store £10 and invest the rest on your behalf. That £90 that they invest may well end up being deposited in a bank, and so on, but there's still only £100 in existence, no money has been created.<br>
<br>

In your scenario there is now £190 in existance. the original person still has £100 and now the next person has £90 that they need to pay back with interest. This cash is can be used to bid up priced and is inflationary.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Without wanting to sound patronising there are plenty of explanations about how it works and with different scenarios.<br>
<br>

<br>
No, there's still only the £100 pounds. When it says £100 on your bank<br>
balance, it seems like you've actually got £100, but really the bank's<br>
gone off and invested £90, so you've actually got £10 and a promise<br>
from the bank that it'll <em>try</em> and get you the £90 back if you<br>
withdraw it. So sometimes you get a 'run' on the bank, where everyone<br>
tries to get their original investment back, but that can't be done<br>
immediately (and maybe not at all) because they've only got the £10<br>
that they didn't invest. If the bank made good investments with your<br>
money they'll get it back eventually, but if not then you'll never see<br>
your money again. Unless of course the tax payer bails the bank out.<br>
But at no stage does the bank create new money, only the central bank<br>
can do that.<br></p>
