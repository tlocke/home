    <p>I got a bulk email from Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall advertising his <a href="http://www.fishfight.net/">Fish Fight</a> campaign.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.fishfight.net/share/images/site/logo.png"><img alt="Fish Fight Logo" src="http://www.fishfight.net/share/images/site/logo.png"></a><br>
The campaign is asking people to sign the <a href="http://www.fishfight.net/letter/">following letter</a>:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>To Commissioner Damanaki, Members of the European Parliament and all member state governments,  </p>
<p>I have seen images of dead and dying fish discarded in European waters.  </p>
<p>I understand that the current Common Fisheries Policy leads to discarding on a vast scale; for example, half of all fish caught in the North Sea are being discarded because of the current quota system imposed by the CFP.  </p>
<p>I want this senseless waste of food to end. I want you to use your influence to stop this unacceptable and shameful practice.  </p>
<p>I am supporting the Fish Fight campaign to help bring about this vital change in our seas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have signed the letter, but it doesn't provide any solutions. I think a first step would be stop the EU fishing subsidies. From 2000 to 2006 the <a href="http://fishsubsidy.org/faqs/">EU fishing subsidy was 6bn EUR</a>.</p>
