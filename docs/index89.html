            <p>Dear reader, today is election day in Trowbridge. I voted before work, and there was a trickle of people at the polling station. Both West Wilts District Council and Trowbridge Town Council are up for election. I'm ashamed to say that I'm ignorant of the candidates, and local party policies …</p>

            <p>I agree, one of the great things about the film is its ambiguity.  </p>
<p>I must confess that having read one Dean Koontz book hasn't motivated me to read more. Reading K-Pax might be interesting though.</p>

            <p>I've always instinctively loved the idea of markets, and in The Wisdom of Crowds, James Surowiecki gives a very readable exposition of the idea of groups making decisions. It could do with a bit of proof reading though. To remain true to the ideas he champions, Surowiecki should really have …</p>
