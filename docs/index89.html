            <p>Agreement! But I'm fairly sure that prostitution itself is not illegal; it is the act of soliciting for paid sex that is illegal. So prostitutes can have sex with their clients, but they can only find clients through telepathy or serendipity.  </p>

            <p>Emily sent me <a href="http://environment.independent.co.uk/lifestyle/article2666422.ece">an article on GM crops</a> which at first plunged me into confusion. I find the whole GM thing very complicated and hard to think about. Then it struck me that the whole situation would be simplified and improved if the idea of patents were abolished.  </p>

            <p>I found out that Janos was a fan of Iain Banks. I asked him, 'what's your favourite Banks sci-fi book then?', he said it was Player of Games. I thought I'd read them all, but when he outlined the plot I realized I hadn't. Excellent!  </p>

            <p>You'd have thought so, but since March 2005, the UK government can issue a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6268959.stm">Control Order</a>. This means you're effectively punished without a trial. I think this is wrong.</p>

            <p>I saw Tim Lott on tv once, he was taking part in a discussion on one of those arts review programmes. He dominated the argument, talking forcefully, almost agressively. Armando Iannucci was there (seemed a bit unsure of himself) and also Andrew Davies. Davies was Lott's main opponent, but no …</p>
