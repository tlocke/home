    <p>Here's a conversation I'm having with my bank, <a href="http://www.smile.co.uk/">Smile</a>. Since it doesn't show them at their best, I thought I'd preface the thread by saying that Smile are an excellent bank in general. Their customer service is usually very good, and even in this instance everyone's polite and doing their best. Recently, many banks (Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds TSB and HBOS) somehow persuaded the government to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8394393.stm">bail them out using tax payer's money</a>. Smile (owned by the Cooperative Bank) hasn't asked for (or received) any handouts from the taxpayer, so I salute them for that.  </p>
<p>Anyway, Smile are a good bank, I just seem to have hit a blind spot with them, which the following thread shows:  </p>

Hi, could you send me a hardcopy statement
with my name, address and international bank
account number please? The internation bank
account number (IBAN) is needed, and so I think
you might have to print it out manually as it
doesn&#39;t come out on your automatic statements.

Thanks for your help,

Tony.

Hello Tony

I can provide you with a statement but there
is a charge of £2.50. Would you still like
a statement?

If it is just the IBAN you require please find
the details below:

IBAN FORMAT xxxxxxxx

Thanks

It&#39;s actually a statement with the IBAN on it
that I&#39;m after. I&#39;m happy to pay the £2.50
as long as it has the IBAN on and my name and
address.

Thanks,

Tony.

Hello Tony


I&#39;ve ordered the last statement for you today
and this should be with you within 5-7 working
days. This will be the original copy with your
name, address and IBAN.

Thanks

Hi, I&#39;m afraid it doesn&#39;t have the IBAN on it
as I requested.Can you send me out a statement
that does have the IBAN please. Also, I wouldn&#39;t
expect to be charged again as this is still the
same request.

Thanks,

Tony.

Hello Tony

We actually do not need to issue out a statement
for you if it is just the IBAN number that you
require. The IBAN for your account is:

xxxxxxxx

Thanks

I already know my IBAN, I just need it printed
out on my statement. As I said originally:

Hello Tony

I&#39;m sorry the statement didn&#39;t arrive. I can see
the statement was produced on 26th April. I&#39;ve
another copy (free of charge) and it will be
sent to xxxxxxxx which I trust is correct?

Thanks

xxxxxxxx

Hi,the one produced on 26th April doesn&#39;t have
the IBAN printed on it, which I need. I was
subsequently told that another one had been
printed and sent (that would have the IBAN),
but that didn&#39;t arrive. As I said originally:

&#39;Could you send me a hardcopy statement with
my name, address and international bank account
number please?&#39;

Hello Tony

I can confirm I have requested for another copy
to be sent to myself so I can investigate why
there is no IBAN number on the statement. Please
allow 10 working days for this to be
investigated.

Thanks

xxxxxxxx

Hi, three months ago I made the request below,
and despite a slew of messages back and forth
it still hasn&#39;t been resolved. Could you look
into this please?

Thanks,

Tony.

Hi, I did receive several statements, but
they didn&#39;t have the IBAN on, which was what I
originally requested.

Please can you send me a statement which has the
IBAN on it. I&#39;ve received sheafs of statements,
but none have the IBAN on them.

Regards,

Tony.

Hi, I know what my IBAN is, the thing I&#39;m asking
is for it to be printed out on your headed
paper. As I said back in April:

could you send me a hardcopy statement with
my name,
address and international bank account number
please?

Thanks,

Tony.

Hello Tony

I do apologise for all the problems you have
had trying to obtain a headed confirmation of
your Iban, name and address.

I have passed your request to a Manager to type
and post a letter out to you, today, confirming
the details you have requested.

Thanks

xxxxxxxx
