    <p>The one plot flaw is that Atticus or Aunt Alexandra would have gone to the pageant. It was a big event in Maycomb, and their daughter / niece was in it. Also, Alexandra was in the same social circle as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_characters#Mrs._Merriweather">Mrs Merriweather</a> the organizer of the pageant, and Alexandra wouldn't snub Merriweather by not attending.  </p>

<p>Incidentally, I've noticed what I think is an error in the Merriweather section on Wikipedia, let me know what you think of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_To_Kill_a_Mockingbird_characters&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=406866811&amp;oldid=406738363">my edit</a>.  </p>
<p>The book was lent to me ages ago by Clive at work. For some reason it sat unread on a table in my dining room, on top of Matt's collection of Clint Eastwood western DVDs. I've received increasingly strong hints from Clive about returning the book, so I read it on Friday / Saturday. Just gotta remember to put it in my bag, and then hand it to him.  </p>
<p>Back to the book. At the end they were wrong to cover up what actually happened with Ewell. There should have been a proper investigation. What do you think?  </p>
<p>Btw, I'm not very good at saying how good a book is. Needless to say, this is a good book.</p>
