    <p>I've seen a couple of good articles on UK nuclear subsidies recently. The <a href="http://www.energyfair.org.uk/home/nuclear-subsidy">first article</a> is by Gerry Wolff. Here's an excerpt:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no justification of any kind for subsidising nuclear power and there is every reason to ensure that nuclear power is not on the list of technologies that would be eligible for support via the CfD. We may thus avoid what would otherwise be the considerable risk of creating nuclear white elephants that would be paid for mainly by consumers that are least able to afford them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/taxpayer-billions-could-be-secretly-funnelled-to-edf-to-underwrite-cost-of-proposed-power-station-at-hinkley-point-8473810.html">second article</a> is by Tom Bawden in The Independent. He says:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Billions of pounds of taxpayers money could be secretly funnelled to the French state nuclear company Edf to underwrite the cost of its proposed new power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset, it emerged today.  </p>
<p>The energy bill has quietly granted energy secretary Ed Davey the power to keep contract details of the crucial Hinkley Point C project a secret if he decides it is commercially sensitive to disclose them, an analysis of the bill has revealed.  </p>
<p>Experts condemned the provision, saying it paves the way for the government to write a cheque for billions of dollars to cover the cost of budget over-runs or building delays at Hinkley Point, without the public or parliament ever finding out.</p>
