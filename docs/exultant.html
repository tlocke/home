    <p>I had a few minutes to spare and I wandered to the library and found a book by Stephen Baxter. It was highly engaging. Anyway, I had to leave before I'd got more than a few pages in.  </p>
<p>Then some time later when I needed a book to read I went back to try and find it. I couldn't, so I got Exultant.  </p>
<p><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c6/Exultant-Baxter.JPG"><img alt="Exultant" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c6/Exultant-Baxter.JPG"></a>  </p>
<p>Well now I've got it all worked out. The book I originally started reading was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendent_%28novel%29">Transcendent</a>, the second in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny%27s_Children">Destiny's Children</a> series, but I ended up reading the second book in that series, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exultant_%28book%29">Exultant</a>.  </p>
<p>Are you still with me? Do you still care? Hey, wake up!!  </p>
<p>There are great ideas in Exultant. Baxter really is at the top of his game. This is the the first time I can remember that I've come across the idea of life existing at different stages of the universe's early life. In one extraordinary piece, there's a grand war across the whole of the universe between two ancient civilizations. After the saga is told, it is revealed that the universe is now 10cm across, and only a small fraction of a second has elapsed.  </p>
<p>As well as having stunning ideas, Baxter writes a good story with well defined characters.  </p>
<p>Good though it is, I don't think the future will be anything like this. I should really put my money where my mouth is and write a story myself.  </p>
<p>But the only way that's going to happen is if somebody kidnaps me and doesn't let me out until I've written a book.</p>
