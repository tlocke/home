    <p>2001: A Space Odyssey is one of those films you know a lot about before seeing it. Some would say, 'it carries a weight of expectation'. Well, one thing I can certainly say is that afterwards you really feel you've seen a *proper* film. I expect that Lawrence of Arabia would have the same effect.  </p>
<p>Someone asked, 'what's the story?'. As I started to explain, I realized there were big gaps in my understanding (this happens a lot). My friend Jonathan has read the book and has a better grasp of these things than me, and set me straight on a few points.  </p>
<p>The other question people ask is, 'what does the last bit mean?'. It seems to be aliens communicating with the human, and trying to find a common visual language. In short, I don't know what it means.  </p>
<p>Each scene of the entire film is exquisitely shot; visually a pleasure. It's funny how much 2001 looks like the 60s though!  </p>
<p>The film has an intermission. An intermission! Bring back intermissions.</p>
