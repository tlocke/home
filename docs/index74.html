            <p>The issue of ROC retirement is an interesting one. Most 'green' packages are not green at all - if all ROCs are sold on then users of these packages are actually subsidising the electricity price of non-green tariffs by paying over the odds for the mandatory renewable part. As far as …</p>

            <p>2001: A Space Odyssey is one of those films you know a lot about before seeing it. Some would say, 'it carries a weight of expectation'. Well, one thing I can certainly say is that afterwards you really feel you've seen a *proper* film. I expect that Lawrence of Arabia …</p>

            <p>I heard someone on the radio advocating road pricing. I'm in favour of this, so I've added an <a href="http://www.tlocke.org.uk/page/16">article on road pricing</a> to the <a href="http://www.tlocke.org.uk/page/0">Political Manifesto</a>.

            <p>The UK government has given permission for companies to build nuclear power stations. The government say that they will not be subsidised by the taxpayer. As long as they really aren't subsidised (including insurance) then that's okay with me, and I'll explain why.  </p>

            <p>An excellent film that brought up all sorts of moral questions. Boringly, the solution to the problem of conflict diamonds is good regulation. Since the diamond trade is international, it covers many jurisdictions and this makes regulation more difficult. So the meta solution is supra-national political entities such as the …</p>

            <p>Tony, no disrespect to you, but I think you find it very difficult to question the difficulties of the system we live under, and use abstract unreal concepts like "free trade" " democracy" etc to avoid actually recognising and talking about them.
