    <p>This is a stack of books before being taken to the charity shop round the corner. It's not that these are bad books. Far from it. I remember reading Genius at Uni. Inspiring. The thing is that in the new house there's not much room, so things just have to go.  </p>

<p>I've had this old fishing box since I was about 9 (or maybe 12!). My interest in fishing fizzled out, and I used it as a tool box. I've got a new tool box now, and I don't need two.  </p>

<p>An assortment of things. Swimming trunks that are too small. Shorts that are too short. My brother's skiing hat that he must have worn the second time I went skiing. Was I 10? I was nine the first time I went. The sort of bandanna type things that I used to have to wear when I had really long hair if I didn't want it getting in my eyes.  </p>

<p>I've just started to clear out the garage of the house in Trowbridge. Here are two old toys from my childhood. I can't remember which year I was in at St Laurence school when we had to make a model of the Saxon church. We were provided with a cardboard net, but I used Linka to make plaster tiles which I stuck together. I didn't come first, but did well enough to be awarded a Mars bar.<br>
Books like The Mad Motorists were a fixture on the bookshelves in our house. I never read them, but the spine's are very familiar. It's so sad to throw them out, but if I didn't throw things out I'd be living in a heap of junk.  </p>
