    <p>Food prices are rising, the poor risk hunger, what should governments do?  </p>
<p>Some advocate price controls. The problem is that if prices are kept artificially low, the food business won't be so profitable and supply will decrease.  </p>
<p>Some say that if your country's people are going hungry, it's madness to be <em>exporting</em> food, so food exports should be banned. The problem is that this depresses prices, which again leads to a decrease in supply.  </p>
<p>I think the real problem is that some people are poor. In the UK we actually tax the poor, and I've heard it said that poor people pay more tax as a proportion of their wealth than rich people. All taxes that aren't related to income should be abolished. This includes National Insurance and VAT. How would this be paid for?  </p>
<ul>
<li>Ending agricultural subsidies</li>
<li>Legalizing prostitution</li>
<li>Legalizing drugs.</li>
<li>Abolishing the national minimum wage.</li>
<li>Freeing up trade by ending protectionism.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we took these steps, then we could let food prices find their correct level, and be confident that people could afford to pay for it.</p>
