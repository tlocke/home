    <p>I had the idea for The-Elected.com in 1999, it would be a directory of the world's democratically elected politicians. I worked on it, and it came to fruition, but never really became popular. Then along came Wikipedia, and even though the information in The-Elected was marked up in XML ready for the semantic web, that distinction was too subtle for users.  </p>
<p>The-Elected had one final incarnation where you could click anywhere on a Google map of the USA and Australia and it would take you to the Wikipedia page of that political constituency. I liked that idea, but again it never became popular. I've now decided to abandon The-Elected.  </p>
<p>Even though it hasn't been successfull in its own right, it has taught me an immense amount about programming and the internet. Thank you The-Elected, and goodbye!</p>
