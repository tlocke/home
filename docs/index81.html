            <p>Well, UK trains are among the cheapest in Europe if you include subsidies.  </p>
<p>But the main thing is that privatization only works if it's done well. I think UK rail was botched, so we're not really seeing all the benefit we could.  </p>

<p>I like your idea about government leaving private enterprise to it, but what happens when it's just not up to the job? Do you bail it out with public money - like with Railtrack and Northern Rock?</p>

            <p>Yes, that's true, nationalizing it would put an end to buck passing. The problem is that it would also put an end to competition, and competition drives standards up and prices down. It also puts the government in the nice position of being able to regulate the industry without having …</p>

            <p>The Mosques of Istanbul, Handel's Messiah, illuminated manuscripts, Aretha Franklin and Sun Ra, the printing press, feasts, festivals, collosseums, cathedrals, pyramids and terracotta armies... it's astonishing what people can do when they have a God who's bigger than they are. Religion doesn't only bring out the worst in humans.  </p>
