    <p>Somehow I already knew the basic idea behind Ender's Game. The idea reached me by word of mouth; I was infected by the meme! Then one day I was discussing the meme with Janos, who knew the book and lent it to me.  </p>
<p>Ender's Game did not disappoint. Perhaps the aim of sci-fi is to combine a brilliant idea with a gripping story. Ender's Game certainly did that, and it's lasting reputation is deserved.  </p>
<p>One gripe I have when writing about books and films is that many of them aren't <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_content">free content</a>. I'm part of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Culture_movement">free culture movement</a>. I'm in favour of the idea of property for physical things, but intellectual property is an oxymoron. When you're talking about information, a whole new set of rules apply. You should be able to do anything you like with information; copy it, sell it, modify it, whatever. The only thing you shouldn't be able to do is remove these freedoms.</p>
