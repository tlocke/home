    <p>A label on this said Habitat, which of course doesn't exist any more. Or have they still got one shop open? Anyway, it used to be my desk lamp. I remember it at University, clamped to the desk.  </p>

<p>This squash racquet is a lot older. At Dauntsey's there were squash courts. I enjoyed playing and wasn't that good, but could hold my own. I distinctly remember playing against someone and Dappo (one of the alpha-male types) came up and offered his support and encouragement and advice on a feud I was having with someone. I can't remember the guy's name. Let's call him Guy. I'd had a fight with Guy after a hockey game. I'd got a nose bleed and so the result of the fight looked much worse than it actually was. It was perhaps the next day when I was playing squash that Dappo heard about the fight and came to find me. I think he thought that an injustice had occurred and it was his job as unofficial leader to help the weaker members of the group (me). I politely declined his help.  </p>

<p>This looks like some notes on TheElected, the now defunct online directory of all the planet's elected representatives. I gave up on the idea. My I shouldn't have done. The best thing about it was that you could click on any point on the globe and it would tell you all your elected representatives. Cool!  </p>

<p>This is when I did some work for Alan Beadnell. We had plans for a lot more work. I can remember planning one of the first online estate agents. Pity that never got off the ground. I did do a kind of JavaScript fruit machine gadget.  </p>

<p>Apparently I applied for a job as a mailing machine operator at the Theatre Royal in Bath. I'd forgotten about that. Didn't get the job.  </p>
