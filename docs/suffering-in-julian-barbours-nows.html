    <p>My question is simple. If time were stopped, would people carry on feeling the same sensation as when time stopped? Or would they stop feeling anything? Or some other answer?</p>
<p>I tell you why I ask. I was going for a jog and it was really cold. I was cold, aching and just wanted to get home. I thought to myself, if time were to stop, would I carry on feeling like this for eternity? In fact is there another me in one of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Barbour">Julian Barbour's Nows</a> that will always feel like I did?</p>
<p>To put the question another way, if time were stopped, distance would still exist, but motion would not. Is sensation like distance or like motion?</p>
