    <p>I hired a special vacuum cleaner to clean up after the builders had finished at Belvoir Road.  </p>

<p>A phone bill from my time at Belvoir Road, just to prove to myself that I lived there.  </p>

<p>Ancient model kit of missiles. I remember this from when I was a kid. I only got round to doing a few of the missiles, but the ones I did do were carefully painted in the right colours.  </p>

<p>The recorder on the left was always around in my childhood. I can remember playing London's Burning on a recorder at primary school.  </p>
<p>The thing on the right is from a gift shop in a ski town that I went to as a child (Aprica perhaps?). I brought it back for my parents. Can't think what they made of it!  </p>

<p>I spent ages making and painting plastic models when I was young...  </p>

<p>More models...  </p>
