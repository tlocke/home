    <p>Bill warned me that The Dark River wasn't as good as <a href="/traveller.html">The Traveller</a>, but I was pleasantly surprised by this, the second book in the Fourth Realm Trilogy by J12H. It carries on the exciting adventures of Gabriel and the Harlequins and Travellers.</p>
<p>Like many others, J12H classes privacy as a freedom. I don't. Freedoms to me are freedom of speech and freedom of association. Also important to me is democracy. The Tabula of the book are undemocratic criminals. I also regard the Harlequins as criminals. If this were real-life I'd say, 'a plague on both your houses'.</p>
<p>But that would have made a boring book. Secret, mysterious things, and violence and guns are fun to read about. I'm looking forward to book three!</p>
